Thank You to our Social Committee and all those who helped with our Parish Picnic and Chili Cook Off this past Saturday There was a great turn out in the Social Hall after Mass and the evening was a wonderful success Also a spe cial Thank You to all those who joined us for our Animal and Pet Blessing this past Friday on the Feast of St Francis of Assisi It was a great joy to gather together as stewards of creation and give thanks to God for our animals and pets Mark your calendars Our next major parish function will be our 2nd Annual All Saints Day Party following the 5:30PM evening Mass on Friday November 1st the Solemnity of All Saints More to come as the date draws near Last weekend we looked at the Liturgical Calendar and the different colors of Vestments seen throughout the Church Year Given where we currently are in the li turgical year we focused on the green worn during Ordinary Time As this liturgical period reflects the ordinary and quiet growth of both Jesus from childhood to the beginning of His public ministry and the Church following Jesus Ascension we saw how the liturgical color of green symbolizes hope and growth Now we will look at specific meanings that can often be hidden in plain sight within priestly vestments looking at a personal vestment of mine that I had the chance to bless with our Reli gious Ed students this past weekend As mentioned last week Ive had the opportunity to personally commission a vestment in memory of my late grandparents Rocco Margaret and William Johana from a local seamstress Mrs Mary Muhlenkamp of Geneva mother of Fr Ben Muhlenkamp of St Louis Bescanon in New Haven As this vestment worn at Mass today was made as a way to commemorate my grandparents there was no doubt in my mind that it should be anything but a green vestment for Ordinary Time My grand parents passed down the Faith to my parents and through them to my siblings and myself They did so in a very ordinary way by living out the Faith in their daily lives The Faith quietly grew in my life by the simple witness of my grandparents and parents living out the Faith in their lives This is one of the ways the Faith is ulti mately spread From parent to child in the ordinary ways of life The green of this vest ment represents the quiet growth of Faith in the everyday and the hope that the Faith the greatest gift we can give continues to be passed on by each of our families in the same way On the back of this vestment is a pelican The pelican is an ancient Christian symbol based on a longstanding legend regarding this bird It was often said that the pelican would wound itself in times of famine to feed its young with its own blood The early Christians communities saw this parallel between the pelican and the Eucha rist as Jesus nourishes us with His own Body and Blood and adopted the symbol of the pelican feeding its young as a sign of Christ feeding His Church To continue this parallel parents are often called in their daily lives to make tremendous sacrifices for their children as they give of themselves freely and fully The pelican featured on this vestment serves as a re minder of these sacrifices At Mass we are made present to the singular Sacrifice of Jesus Christ upon the Cross this moment of selfgift that stands outside of time itself In being made pre sent to this sacrifice we experience Gods love in the most unique of ways From this Sacrifice we learn how to love And this love learned leads us to be able to sacrifice for those whom we love Just as my grandparents made great sacrifices for my parents so to did my parents for my siblings and myself It is from these sacrifices and this love of family that has brought me to this very altar to offer the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ May we never be afraid to make sacrifices to carry our own crosses out of love for God and neighbor These are just a few of the symbols and meanings found in this vestment If you have any questions regarding any other aspect of it feel free to ask me Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF OCTOBER 1920 2019 CANTORS 500 Sophia Emrah 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Jay Crisp Choir Mass LECTORS 500 Ginny Fenstermaker 730
