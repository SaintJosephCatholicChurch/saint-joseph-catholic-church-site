spiritual side of creation Food and drink will be available for purchase at the Brewery The Liturgy of the Word to the Liturgy of the Eucharist Following the proclamation of the Gospel the Liturgy of the Word next continues with the Homily then the recitation of the Creed and finally the lifting up of the Prayers of the Faithful The Homily from the Greek word for conversation is meant to be part of the conversation between God and His people Not merely a moment of catechesis it is meant to be a moment proclaiming the great deeds of salvation and the demands of the covenant In the words of Pope Francis the Homily is meant to be a moment where it is God who seeks to reach out to us through the preacher and that He displays His power through human words The Homily gives way to the recitation of the Creed At Mass we profess the Nicene Creed These words originated from the Council of Nicea in AD 325 where the Church Fathers affirmed the divinity and humanity of Jesus In the Creed we make an explicit and deliberate profession of faith as our response to hearing the Word of God This parallels the Israelites response after Moses read from the book of the covenant All that the Lord has spoken we will do and we will be obedient Exodus 247 This profession of the Creed not only expresses what we believe but also recommits us to this belief May the words we profess in the Creed transform the very way we live Having professed the Creed together as one we continue this unity in the Prayers of the Faithful as we make our intercessions known before the Lord The Liturgy of the Word comes to a close as we lift up our prayers for others following St Paul's early instruction that supplications prayers intercession and thanksgivings be made for all men for kings and for all who are in high positions 1 Timothy 21 2 As the Liturgy of the Word concludes these intercessory prayers serve as a foretelling of the ultimate intercession of Christ crucified that approach in the Liturgy of the Eucharist The Liturgy of the Eucharist itself begins with the Offertory and the Preparation of the Gifts as the altar is prepared and a collection taken up to support the work of the Church All of this preparation and action is interlaced with vast symbolism and several quiet prayers As a whole the Liturgy of the Word is where we receive nourishment through the preaching and teaching of Christ Entering into the Liturgy of the Eucharist we now enter into the celebration of Christ's ultimate sacrificial act of love on the cross We note a change in the directionality of dialogue as the dialogue between the Priest and the Faithful gives way to a dialogue between the Priest speaking on behalf of the Faithful and God the Father Note If you will be away in the coming
