  "text": "WENTY IXTH UNDAY I RDINARY IME EPTEMBER 26 2021 Upon entering the Church this weekend September 25th 26th for the Twentysixth Sunday in Ordinary Time you will be greeted by our newly repaired cleaned and renovated baptismal font This font set in the narthex is meant to serve as a reminder of our baptism Through the waters of baptism the faithful enter into the Church and become members of the Body of Christ The baptismal font and its location in the narthex which greets us on our journey through the nave of the Church towards the step of the sanctuary at Holy Communion reflect the Christians journey through the waters of baptism to the altar This visual representation reminds us of a theological truth The rites of initiation of the Church begin with baptism and are completed by the reception of the Eucharist and Confirmation as well In a similar and practical manner we will now be able to bless the casket in a funeral Mass with holy water directly from the baptismal font As our beloved deceased are greeted at the entrance of the Church we are to call to mind the comforting promise made to us in baptism If we live and die with the Lord we too shall rise with Him cf Romans 6311 After the casket is blessed with holy water it is draped with a white pall symbolizing the white garment received at baptism Once again a special Thank You to our GIRLs Night Out for their fundraising efforts to make this project possible If you are interested in learning more about Church architecture and guidelines for the placement of various items in the Church I would recommend reading the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops document Built of Living Stones Art Architecture and Worship IRST RIDAY AND IRST ATURDAY EVOTIONS This coming Friday October 1st marks the first Friday of the month First Fridays are often associated with devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus First Saturdays with the Immaculate Heart of Mary On these devotional days the Faithful are encouraged to assist at Mass and go to Confession To help promote these two devotions we will be adding additional times for confession on both First Fridays and First Saturdays Confessions on First Fridays will be heard from 500 5:45PM and on First Saturdays from 830 9:00AM ASS OF OLEMN ONSECRATION TO IFE OF IRGINITY Next Sunday October 3rd our diocese will celebrate a Mass of Solemn Consecration to a Life of Virginity for Ms Anne Therese Stephens life time consecration of virginity is one of the most ancient practices within the Church traced back to 110 AD in the writings of St Ignatius of Antioch In a consecration to a life of virginity Anne Therese will promise to live a life of perfect continence for the sake of Christ and His Church Differing from religious life the consecrated virgin does not live in a convent or in any form of communal life Instead she continues to live in the world and serve the Church according to her own natural and spiritual gifts Though this consecration had seemingly fallen into disuse over the years it was restored by Pope St Paul VI in 1970 as a fruit of the Second Vatican Council Anne Therese has invited our parish to join her on this joyous day Sunday October 3rd at 3 PM in the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception Please see the letter from Anne Therese on the bulletin board for more details MASS
