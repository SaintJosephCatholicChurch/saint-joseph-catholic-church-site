2019 After all Masses this weekend the Blessing of Throats will be offered in celebra tion of the feast day of Saint Blaise on February 3rd St Blaise is believed to have been a physician before becoming a priest and eventually the bishop of Sebaste Legend holds that he saved a young boy choking on a fish bone St Blaise was eventually targeted in the 4th Century persecution against Christians and for refusing to renounce his faith in Jesus Christ was tortured and be headed in 316 AD As we return to Ordinary Time we will resume offering our monthly discussion forum in between our Sunday Masses These forums will continue to touch upon a variety of topics and will be held the second Sunday of each month between the 7:30AM and 10 AM Mass in the Parish Social Hall For this month we will have our discussion forum next Sunday February 10th at 8:30AM in the Parish Social Hall Given several questions Ive re ceived this past week regarding recent events in the news cycle the topic for our February discussion forum will be the Churchs understanding of the grave evil of abortion Similar to our previous discussions there will be a brief over view of the Churchs teachings on this matter and the current events surrounding it before opening the floor for discussion I would encourage you to invite all those you feel would benefit from such a discussion to join in Given the topic of our open discussion our first reading Jeremiah 145 1719 offers a beautiful insight from the Lord Before I formed you in the womb I knew you before you were born I dedicated you This introductory text pro vides us with an accounting of the call of the prophet Jeremiah Jeremiah wrote half a century before the Babylonian exile and condemned the practice of idola try prevalent throughout the kingdom of Judah As our reading warns the prophet will face much persecution for his preaching as he calls Judah to repen tance Though this persecution may at times seem overwhelming the Lord as sures Jeremiah that if he remains faithful to the word given to him the Lord will preserve him against all trials The ability to face persecution for the Lords sake is according to St Paul in our second reading 1 Corinthians 12311313 found in the love of God The love of God is able to bear and endure all things and never fails In the original Greek that St Paul wrote in love can often be articulated through four different words Eros romantic love Storge familial love Philia friendship a gape perfect love In this passage he exclusively uses the word agape which is charity the highest form of love that originates in God and manifests itself through sac rifice for others This sacrificial love allows us to cast aside our own selfishness and instead to live our lives entirely for one another This sacrificial love that St Paul speaks of is seen most perfectly in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the Cross As Jesus pours Himself out fully for us we are urged to do the same for one another in imitation of our Lord It is this love that will allow Jeremiah to give himself entirely to Judah and continue to offer prophecy for their salvation even as they are persecuting him It is this love that we find made present to us at each and every Mass as we are made present to Jesus sacrifice on the Cross and receive the sacrament of love the Holy Eucha rist The love of God is shown in our Gospel today Luke 42130 as Jesus reminds Israel that Gods message of salvation is for Jew and Gentile alike Jesus rebukes the selfishness of those gathered This rebuke infuriates them and they attempt to kill our Lord but are unable to do so This rejection will continue throughout the Gospel story but does not stop the mission of Jesus Christ Our blessed Lord does not act for His own regard or wellbeing but for ours His love agape for us knows no bounds as He continues the selfless walk to the Cross We experi ence this love every time that we receive the Holy Eucharist In receiving the Bread of Life we are to be transformed by the perfect love of God and become more like Him in all ways How can we imitate His perfect and sacrificial love in our lives today Fr David WEEKEND OF

STEWARDSHIP CORNER The refusal to take sides on great moral issues is itself a decision It is a silent acquiescence to evil The Tragedy of our time is that those who still believe in honesty lack fire and conviction while those who believe in dishonesty are full of passionate conviction Venerable Fulton Sheen PARISH CALENDAR OF UPCOMING EVENTS Mon Feb 3 Alpha 6:30pm to 8:00pm in the social hall
