<p>Our goal for the St. Joseph Religious Education Program is to create a good learning environment and experience for our students and to bring our students and their parents to a closer relationship with God.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;appreciate our&nbsp;dedicated catechists who give of their time and talent teaching our students about their Catholic faith.</p>
<p>Religious education classes meet Sunday morning 8:30-9:45 September through April.</p>
