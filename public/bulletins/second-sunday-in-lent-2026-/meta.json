Sunday of Lent March 1 2026 This weekend February 28th March 1st the Church celebrates the Second Sunday of Lent Following the temptation in the desert our Gospel brings us to Mount Tabor and the glory of the Transfiguration Often our Lenten journey takes us from the lowness of the desert and spiritual dryness to the mountain tops and moments of overwhelming spiritual consolation These highs and lows are part of our true relationship with the Lord Like St Peter today we might want to say It is good that we are here when we experience those mountain top moments of overwhelming spiritual consolation We too might want to build tents to remain in those moments for as long as we can Yet the mountain top is not the destination It's only part of the journey Just as the disciples walked up Mount Tabor with the Lord so they could not remain there Instead they walked back down with Him The meaning of the Transfiguration is not to replace the Cross but to strengthen us for it The light of Mount Tabor prepares us to face the darkness of Mount Calvary As in the Scriptures so too in our lives God sometimes grants clarity peace and joy in prayer not so that we cling to the feeling but so that we may carry its memory into the valleys that follow Lent is neither a season solely of spiritual dryness nor constant consolation It is a journey On Tuesday the priests of the Diocese will gather for our annual Lenten Day of Recollection Please pray for us on Tuesday as we dedicate this time of prayer to growing in our spiritual fatherhood Due to this day away from the parish there will be no morning Adoration Mass or Confession this Tuesday St Joseph Day Mass and Trivia Night On Thursday March 19th we will celebrate the Solemnity of St Joseph our Parish Patron In celebration of this great solemnity we will have a special Mass at 6:00PM followed by a Parish Trivia Night from 630 8:30PM Please see the sign up sheet on the table in the back of Church to register your team of up to four for the Trivia Night Each table is welcome to bring snacks to share throughout the evening as we celebrate St Joseph Lent throughout the Liturgy Entering into the Second Sunday of Lent we have already seen how the Lenten practice of fasting can be reflected even in our liturgy As a parish we fast from many of the joyful elements that normally draw our senses to the Lord Our gilded altar candles and crucifix are replaced with more somber wooden ones bleached candles replaced with unbleached candles and the penitential color of violet shrouds the Sanctuary in vestments and altar cloths Liturgical hymns of praise such as the Gloria and the Alleluia do not rise together again from our lips until that solemn night when we celebrate Christ rising from the grave As we recess out from Mass following our Prayer to St Michael we do so in silence Fasting from these joyous hymns that would normally ring from our lips should give us a moment of pause calling us to enter into the silence of the tomb as we reflect on the true cost of our salvation Such liturgical fasting is also meant to help recall to mind the true meaning the practice of fasting The practice of fasting is the means to an end not the end in itself Fasting is a means to heighten our awareness of that which is missing and deepening our sense of gratitude for what we so often may take for granted Fasting assists us as we grow in discipleship as it trains our will and breaks us out of the complacency of the everyday These forty days of Lent are meant to somehow feel different because they are different This journey walked every single year of our earthly life is meant to draw us closer and closer to the Lord each and every year Though our world and our culture may not recognize a difference in these sacred days let us allow the differences we see and hear be a reminder that we are called to something different to something greater to Heaven Saturday February 28 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary
