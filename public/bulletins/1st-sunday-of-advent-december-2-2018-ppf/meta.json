12638 Sun Dec 9 Second Sunday of Advent Bar 519 Phil 146811 Lk 316 First Sunday of Advent December 2 2018 Year As a reminder the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception a Holy Day of Obligation is Saturday December 8 As our Blessed Mother under the title of the Immaculate Conception is the patroness of our country this Holy Day is NOT transferred to the Sunday and is celebrated as its own day This means that we will be blessed to gather for the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass twice be tween this coming Friday through Sunday for our Holy Day and our Sunday obligations The Holy Day Masses will be Friday Dec 7 at 5:30PM and Saturday Dec 8 at 7:30AM and 10 AM Our Weekend Mass Schedule for the 2nd Sunday of Advent will remain the same Saturday Vigil at 5 PM Sunday at 7:30AM and 10 AM Note If the need arises you may attend the Saturday Vigil Mass to fulfill the Holy Day Obligation but will also need to assist at Mass on Sunday for our Sunday Obligation Advent Updates As we enter the Advent season we are strongly encouraged to enter into a rou tine use of the Sacrament of Confession to help prepare our hearts for the coming of Jesus Christ Our annual Advent Penance Service will be on Thursday Dec 20 from 730830 PM following our Parish Mission speaker 7 PM Confession is also offered every Tuesday at 8:30AM following the 8 AM morning Mass and Saturday from 4445 PM In addition to these times during the Advent season Confession will be offered immediately following each weekend Mass As we are called to conversion throughout the Advent season we see this call echoed in everything we do even within our liturgy Lex orandi lex credendi As we pray so we believe Our Advent wreath and Nativity scene are in full display building our anticipation Our prayers throughout Mass are specifically pointed to call our hearts to attention The priest now wears violet vestments reminding us that Advent is a penitential season a little Lent Everything that we say see and do both at Mass and throughout our day is to help prepare ourselves and our hearts for the coming of Christ on Christmas Day One new addition that we will see in the sanctuary throughout Advent is a new altar cross on our main altar Our traditional altar cross now marks the credence table where the Sacred Vessels are kept during Mass and will return to its place on the main altar in Ordinary Time The new altar cross may seem very familiar to many as it is actually our original cross from the first church on Cherry Street The use of this altar cross is as with our wreath and Nativity to help keep us ever alert throughout the Advent season to the coming of Jesus Christ In addition it also beautifully serves as a constant reminder of our his tory and the 143 years of the practice of the Faith passed down through St Jo sephs here in our town special Thank you to parishionerowned Daniels Jewelers for repairing and polishing the cross from Cherry Street As we grow familiar with our surrounding even in our church sanctuary it is very easy for our hearts to become drowsy These slight differences seen throughout the Advent season are meant to help keep our hearts and minds alert and our focus always on Christ who is our redemption Everything we say see and do most especially at Mass should always keep us alert and bring us closer to Christ What else can we do throughout this penitential season to help prepare ourselves to welcome the advent of Jesus Christ into the world and into our hearts Though Advent has only begun many are planning ahead and have asked for our Christmas Mass times We will joyfully welcome the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ on Monday Dec 24 with the Vigil Mass at 5 PM Mass at Night at 10 PM and on Tuesday Dec 25 with Mass During the Day at 9 AM Note For your planning purposes incense will be used on Dec 24 at 10 PM for the Mass at Night Prior to the Mass at Night 10 PM our Choir will offer a short program More information on that to
