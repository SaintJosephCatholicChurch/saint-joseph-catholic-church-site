perhaps one of the most well known biblical parables Through it our Lord is challenging His followers ourselves included to do the unexpected and put others above ourselves One way our love of God is reflected is through our love of neighbor How will we grow in our love of neighbor today How will we reach out espe cially to those neighbors of ours that we may struggle with How shall we go and do what the Good Samaritan has done Over the past 800 years the Holy Land Franciscans have been tasked with the care of the holy sites and ministry to our brothers and sis ters in the Holy Land Each parish throughout the country supports this needed ministry every year through the Pontifical Good Friday Collection that is taken up during Holy Week In a desire to bring the beauty of the Holy Sites where salvation history itself occurred to as many as possible the Holy Land Franciscans built the Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in America This monastery located in Washington DC is featured on our bulletin cover this weekend Built in 1899 the monastery grounds includes the Memorial Church of the Holy Sepulchre This church designed in the shape of a Je rusalem cross allows pilgrims a chance to experience the holy places on American soil Upon entering the church you find yourself standing out side of the site of Annunciation This shrine is a replica of the home of Mary in Nazareth where the good news was first proclaimed by the Arch angel Gabriel to the Blessed Virgin Luke 12638 Moving from the site of the Annunciation you are greeted by a long stairwell leading up to Calvary and the site of the Crucifixion It is here that our Lord was lifted up upon the Cross and gave His life for us Directly across from Calvary the exact number of steps as it is in Jerusalem itself is the Sepulcher the tomb where our Lords body was laid and from which He three days later rose from the dead Between the two sites is the Anointing Stone the stone slab on which our Lords body was laid to be prepared for burial by Joseph of Arimathea Going into the crypt beneath the shrine one is transported from the holy places in Jerusalem to the Catacombs of Rome Following the intri cate passageways the pilgrim walks among a replica of the early Christian burial sites The dimly lit walls are beautifully decorated with Christian symbols and imagery Though a replica of the Roman Catacombs the catacombs at the Monastery also serve as a burial place and shrine to two martyrs St Innocent a 2nd Century child martyred for the Faith and St Benignus a Roman soldier beheaded for the Faith The Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in America is a hidden gem and one of several beautiful shrines in our nations capital Ive been blessed to make use of the monastery as a place for prayer and reflect on our Lords life throughout the summer If you ever find yourself in Wash ington DC I would encourage you to make a pilgrimage to this shrine and experience the beauty of the Holy Land right here in America Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF JULY 2021 2019 CANTORS 500 Nichole Decker 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Sophia Emrah LECTORS 500 Ginny Fenstermaker 730 Geoff Frank 1000
