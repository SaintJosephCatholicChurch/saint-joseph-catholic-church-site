Green and Dorothy Dottie Marbach 21ST SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME AUGUST 27 2017 YR From the Pastors Desk FOR ETERNAL LIFE AND GLORY WE ARE ADVISED TO OBEY GOD POPE BISHOPS PRIESTS ALL CHURCH AND GOOD CIVIL AUTHORIES My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all It is clear that perseveringly living up to what Jesus Christ stands for cannot be done alone We need one anothers inspiration and encouragement We live Christi anity in groups or congregations So whenever and wherever one establishes a group one needs institution rules and regulations as an alternative to chaos Hence authority becomes a necessity So we are encouraged to support the Pope and the Bishops and their representative Therefore in the 1st Reading Is 221923 The Lord God through Prophet Isaiah stripped Shebna his authority and invested it on Eliakim The Gospel reading of today fulfilled this prophecy in this 1st reading The Church knows that the human instrument of Gods authority on earth can fail but they cannot undo the Divine purpose Hence we pray with the Psalmist of todays Psalm which states thus Lord your love is eter nal do not forsake the work of your hand You can see that we need to pray for the Pope the Bishops and the Priests that they will not fail Then in the 2nd Reading Rom 113336 Paul was trying to describe the bounteous love of God which was visible in Jesus Christ sharing Himself with the sinful human ity God is great powerful and unsearchable And in that His unsearchable way God has planned a future for each and every one of us Do you believe this We need to be lieve it because it true And it is selfevident truth In the Gospel Mt 161320 This Gospel tradition put things in their proper perspec tive Jesus is the Son of God All authority has been given to Him Christ hence He delegated the authority to the Church Mt 1818 by putting it into the hands of Peter the keys of the kingdom Jesus handed to him Peter the authority with which he rules over Gods people together with his fellow apostles Jn 211522 Then Jesus asked a Billion question Who do the people say that the Son of Man is From the answers the apostles gave the people did not know who is He then turned to them and asked the Billion Dollar question Who do you say that I am By the power of God it was revealed to Peter who answered You are the Christ the Son of the living God An amazing answer The Lord Jesus blessed Peter and gave him the keys of the Kingdom of God Jesus question led to make known who He is the Christ the Redeemer So let us obey pray for and cooperate with the Pope the Bishops and the Priests and the deacons to continue to build up the Church which is the Body of Christ For we all are one in the one Family of God and the Lord Jesus Christ in union with the Holy Spirit God bless you Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 We are organizing Marriage Encounter Parish Based Please
