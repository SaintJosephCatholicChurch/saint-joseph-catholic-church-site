in a special way all those who have their lives to protect our freedom Our gratitude and our prayers are with you Thank you for your support of the 32nd Annual Bishops Appeal Your generos ity allows

Narthex after Mass or at the Parish Office The 1 and 2 Book of Kings conclude the several books that are often referred to as the Deuteronomistic History of Israel These works Joshua and Judges 1 2 Samuel and 1 2 Kings follow the history of Israel from the settlement of the prom ised land to the rise of the unified kingdom and its eventual fall to Babylon As we en ter into 1 Kings we find the Davidic kingdom nearing its end Immediately prior to our passage the king of northern Israel Ahab with his wife Jezebel has led Israel to idola try through the worship of the Canaanite deity Baal So astray were Ahab and Jezebel in their idol worship that they sought to put all true prophets of the Lord to death At this moment in our reading then we are introduced to a true prophet of the Lord in Elijah the Tishbite Elijah meaning My God is the Lord In our first reading 1 Kings 171016 we find the prophet Elijah seeking shelter during a great drought This drought holds great significance during the reign of Ahab as the deity he worships Baal is the Canaanite deity responsible for providing rain Though the whole land is suffering drought for following Ahab in his idolatry Elijah is constantly being provided for by the Lord As we now hear the Lord has led him to the widow of Zarephath This woman is both a Gentile and as a widow one who is destitute Though she and her child are preparing to eat their last meal Elijah asks her to trust in him and the Lord who has sent him and she and her child will be provided for Though she does not know Elijah she is willing to trust and as prom ised she her child and Elijah are saved through her trust in the Lord This widows trust in the Lord is paralleled in our Gospel Mark 123844 today As our blessed Lord sits opposites the Temple treasury he singles out the offer ing made by a poor widow The woman like the widow in Elijahs time is one of the poorest members of Jewish society The two coins she offers though worth little mate rial value mean the world to this widow Yet she freely gives them over for the work of the Temple and ultimately the worship of God As our blessed Lord rightly points out her gift though seemingly small to the eyes of the world is tremendous in the eyes of God She has given all that she has trusting that He will provide for her As these widows places their full trust in God we are each called to do the same We are called to do this not only materially but also spiritually Though these two women do not know what the future holds they place themselves fully in the hands of the one who does To place ourselves fully in Gods care means trusting that He will guide us even when we may not see what lies ahead We must be willing to approach the Cross with Christ trusting in the Resurrection that lies beyond The Lord will pro vide as He promises if we are willing to let Him In Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF November 1718 2018 CANTORS 500 Sophie Emrah 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Nancy Leitz LECTORS 500 Ginny
