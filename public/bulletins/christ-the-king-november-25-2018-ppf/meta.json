<a href=\"tel:(212)528-3436\">(212)528-3436</a> Our Lord Jesus Christ King of the Universe November 25 2018 Year While the understanding of Jesus as king of all creation is a biblical theme cf Isaiah 96 Matthew 2818 Rev 1916 the Solemnity of Jesus Christ the King of the Uni verse is itself a relatively new feast day It was first introduced to the liturgical calen dar by Pope Pius XI in his 1926 encyclical Quas Primas In the First This was Pope Pius second encyclical both of which followed shortly after and meditated upon the Great War World War I Having seen the great suffering and loss that resulted from this strife Pope Pius called all people to place Jesus Christ the king of peace and source of salvation at the very center of their lives Only in Jesus Christ can we find true and lasting peace Pope Pius purposely placed this feast at the end of the liturgical year to set the crown ing glory upon the mysteries of the life of Christ already commemorated during the year Quas Primas Para 29 In this way our year begins in preparation for the com ing of Jesus in the flesh throughout the Advent season and appropriately ends with this solemnity recognizing and celebrating Him as King of the Universe As is revealed to St John our Lord is the Alpha and the Omega the First and the Last the Beginning and the End Rev 2213 In the same way Pope Pius reminds us that Jesus is our beginning and end and must reign in every aspect of our lives If we truly claim Jesus Christ as our Lord and King nothing in our lives can ever be kept from Him He must reign in our minds our wills our bodies and our hearts cf QP Para 33 Our reading this weekend highlight Jesus as King In our first reading Daniel 71314 Daniel prophesies that the Son of man which is a title of the Messiah will receive an everlasting kingdom This prophecy coincides with the promise made to King David in 2 Samuel 71116 where the Lord promises David that from his descendants will come the messianic king that will reign forever These prophesies are continued in our second reading Revelation 158 as St John now speaks directly of Jesus The language closely mirrors that of Daniel and speaks of seeing the resurrected Jesus assume His position as King of the Universe Similar to the beginning of his Gospel St John high lights not only Jesus kingship but also His divinity as the one who is and who was and who is to come v 8 As has been prophesied and is now seen in fulfillment Je sus Christ the Son of God reigns as King of the Universe yesterday today and for ever In our Gospel John 183337 we hear the question of Jesus kingship arise directly from the lips of Pilate At this point in the Gospel Jesus has been charged by the San hedrin with having committed blasphemy As they wish to have Him put to death they bring Him before Pilate the Roman governor of Judaea Pilate being a Roman official will not punish Jesus for religious charges Instead the Sanhedrin state that Jesus claims to be a king an act of rebellion against Caesar and punishable by death For this reason Pilate asks Jesus this question Are you a King Jesus does not deny His kingly office in response Instead He clarifies that His kingship is something very different Jesus does not have political or worldly motivations He does not care for wealth or power He is not simply an earthly king but the King of the Universe His domain has no limits and His kingdom will have no end because it is not a kingdom based on this earth which passes away Instead the heavenly kingdom starts first in our hearts Jesus Christ is Lord Next weekend we begin the Advent season We use this time to prepare our hearts to welcome the newborn King Let us use this Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Uni verse to look into our hearts and to see where we may not yet be prepared to welcome Christ We must honestly ask ourselves Do we allow Jesus Christ to be King and Lord of our entire lives or do we hold something back When we find those areas in our hearts where we are not yet prepared to welcome Him let us focus on those areas dur ing the Advent season May we use those four precious weeks to once again open our selves even more fully to the love of God and to our Lord and King Jesus Christ In Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF December 12 2018 CANTORS 500 Jay Crisp Choir Mass 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Sophie Emrah LECTORS 500 Knights of Columbus
