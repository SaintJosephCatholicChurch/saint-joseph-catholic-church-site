continue to give us greater insight into the ultimate question of St Mark's Gospel Who is Jesus Over the past several weeks we have seen that He is one who has dominion over demons creation and even death And despite all this we hear how He is also one who is rejected preparing us His disciples to also be prepared for worldly rejection Our Gospel today shares a commonality with the Gospel from the Tenth Sunday in Ordinary Time as we again hear an allusion made to the brothers and sisters of Jesus Though I spoke on this briefly before now seemed a good time to provide a fuller treatment of these passages Often these passages will be incorrectly used in an attempt to reject the ancient belief of the perpetual virginity of the Blessed Virgin Mary When saying ancient belief we can look to the Proto Evangelium of St James in AD 120 that references Mary having taken a vow of virginity Similarly the early Church Fathers constantly refer to the perpetual virginity of the Blessed Virgin Mary St Hippolytus of Rome refers to the all holy ever virgin Mary in AD 210 Origen the Father of Christian Theology held in AD 248 that Christians preserve the honor of Mary in virginity to the end In addition to stating belief in the perpetual virginity many early Church Fathers defended this belief against those who were erroneously using the Sacred Scriptures to deny it St Hilary of Potiers states in AD 354 that if Mary had other children she would never have been given over in the moment of the crucifixion to the apostle John as his mother To hold belief in the perpetual virginity was seen as a sign of one's unity with the Church For this reason countless early Church Fathers including St Athanasius in AD 360St Epiphanius of Salamis in AD 375 and St Jerome in AD 383 attest that those who deny the perpetual virginity of the Blessed Virgin do not belong to the Church Perhaps most severely St Augustine AD 428 simply refers to those who contradict the perpetual virginity of Mary as heretics What then do these verses that reference the brothers and sisters of the Lord mean Quite simply the Greek word in the Sacred Scriptures adelphos has a broader meaning than our English translation conveys The word can mean sibling relativekinsman eg cousin uncle or those who share deep spiritual bonds The tradition and guidance of the Church as seen above helps us to gain an understanding of this passage's true context This guidance of the Church as guardian and interpreter of the Scriptures not only protects Her unity but also the coherence of the Sacred Scriptures themselves For example we know that two brothers listed here James and Joses are also listed in this same Gospel as children of the other Mary at the Cross with John and the Blessed Mother Mark 1540 1547 161 This only becomes a seeming contradiction if we reject the guidance of the Church Helping Hands Baby Bottles Thank you for your support of the Helping Hands Baby Bottle Campaign We returned
