Rhodes THE ASCENSION OF THE LORD MAY 13TH 2018 YR MOTHERS SUNDAY 7TH SUNDAY OF EASTER MAY 13TH 2018 YR We are invited to Eternal Life of Blessedness in heaven My dear brothers and sisters in Christ the Lord be with you It is an axiomatic truth that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended into heaven to prepare a place for each one of us In fact He has already prepared a place a state of Eternal life life of blessedness for everyone of us We need to take the reality of eternal life very seriously For some people this earthly life is the most important thing for them For others it is heaven and for some still heaven is realized already here on earth in love To which group do you belong Christ is our leader for he is the way the truth and life It is in faith fol lowing Jesus shall we see the transcending reality of God as a loving Father who waits for us his children Where Jesus has gone we hope to follow him It is Ascension that gave meaning to the Resurrection For if Christ did not ascend into heaven where is he now Today is Mothers Sunday It is a special day we respect honor cherish care in a special and love our mothers I want to say that every female is a mother married or not married Motherhood is not in the flesh but in the heart So when I say mother I mean every female In the 1st Reading Acts 1111St Luke the author of the Acts of the Apostles assured us of the Lords ascension He said In the first book Theophilus I dealt with all that Jesus did and taught until the day he was taken up When he had said this as they were looking on he was lifted up and a cloud took him from their sight So he ascended into heaven Two angels confirmed it He will come again from heaven where he has gone that is Ascension And Paul in the 2nd reading Eph 11723 confirmed the Ascension also when he said that God raised him from the dead and seating him at his right hand in the heavens far above every principality authority power and dominion How could Christ sit at Gods right hand if he did not ascend into heaven Then in the Gospel Mk 161520St Mark the Evangelist said it all So then the Lord Jesus after he spoke to them was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God My dear beloved in Christ our task is to do what Christ has done and do what he commanded us to do He commanded us to preach by word and exam ple the Good News everywhere in the world When we do as He has commanded us then we will be good stewards giving good account of our stewardship by making effective use of the gifts and talents God has given to each and every one of us Today is mothers Sunday as I said earlier and each one of us here has a mother living or dead And as such we need to respect love and obey them wherever they are now Every mother is a precious gift of God to us Your mother is a precious gift of God to you Do you hear me Therefore you must love your mother She in a way gave you life We owe them absolute and unquestionable obedience They bring peace and joy to their families good mothers smile radiates life into her family Her thoughtful ness put flesh on the bones of her husband and the bones of all around her Her gov erned speech and firm virtue are gifts from the Lord Modest and chaste woman is a priceless gift from God to humanity She is like the rising sun shining on mount Zion Her beauty and graceful figure are like golden columns in the house of God So please let us take good care of them Take home assignment 1 Who is Theophilus in the 1st Reading 2 Dear Mothers please read EcclesiasticusSirach 26123 NB 1 Remember that May 19th is
