<p>We apologize to those who have followed along with St. Joseph&rsquo;s Masses on our live-stream. Due to some technical difficulties and with Fr. David away, we&rsquo;ve been having difficulty live-streaming each week. We will continue to try to live-stream our Sunday 10 AM Mass each week. If we are unable to do so, we will share the 10 AM Mass from other parishes in our diocese via our Facebook Page. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
