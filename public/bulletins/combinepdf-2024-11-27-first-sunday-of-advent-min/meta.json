Ps 1261 6 Phil 14 6 8 11 Lk 31 6 First Sunday of Advent December 1 2024 This weekend November 30th December 1st the Church begins a new liturgical year and celebrates the First Sunday of Advent Though entering a new liturgical year the theme of our readings remain the same as the past few weekends The Last Things Before we prepare to celebrate the First Coming of the Lord in the Nativity at Bethlehem we take the first two weeks of Advent to prepare for His coming again in judgment The First Coming of the Lord which has already happened in time is best celebrated by preparing ourselves and our hearts for the Parousia the Second Coming of the Lord at the end of time itself Though our readings may seem a bit frightful their true purpose is meant to awaken hearts that are asleep in sin The Church desires that every heart be awakened and prepared to greet our Lord when He comes again The very Season of Advent serves as this time of preparation As such I cannot emphasize enough how we cannot let this season pass us by as if it does not exist The worldly joy of the coming Christmastide is already all around us Yet this time of preparation for it is only now beginning We are not merely preparing for a holiday but for something even greater We are preparing the way for Christ in our lives and our hearts As an incarnational people the Church reminds us of this anticipation for the coming of the Lord in various ways throughout our liturgy The priest dons the somber and penitential color of violet purple for his vestments Church decorations take on this same penitential color The use of flowers a joyful sight is minimalized in the sanctuary Our gilded candlesticks are replaced with more somber toned wooden candlesticks and unbleached candles These reminders are not only visual but also are reflected in what we hear or more importantly what we don't hear Throughout Advent that angelic hymn the Gloria is silenced from our lips It only returns to us as we join the angelic choirs over Bethlehem on Christmas Eve Our hymnody throughout Mass is a bit more sparse Contemplative silence especially after our reception of Holy Communion receives a great place of prominence this season One word that does remain with us throughout Advent differing from the Lenten season is Alleluia This joyful word of gladness is not interrupted during Advent offering a vivid contrast to our other somber practices This serves as a reminder that our preparation is not for naught The Lord has come into the world and He will come again This is why the Alleluia accompanies us even amidst this penitential season as we await the coming of Christ Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception Holy Day of Obligation On Monday December 9th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception which is a Holy Day of Obligation Though this celebration normally falls on December 8th it was transferred this year as its original date falls on the Second Sunday of Advent Given that our nation has been entrusted to the Blessed Mother under this title this is our nation's patronal feast day and as such one we desire to celebrate yearly To help provide for our obligation to assist at Mass on this day we will offer Masses for the Holy Day of Obligation on Monday December 9th at 7:00AM Noon and 7:00PM Living with the Saints This past liturgical year our theme was Living Life Liturgically This new year our theme will be Living with the Saints The liturgical year walks us through the life of our Lord through the various seasons Advent Christmas Lent Easter and Ordinary Time Intermixed throughout the liturgical year are celebrations of the feast days of various Saints The feast day of the Saints help to proclaim the wonderful works of our Lord in the lives of His servants and offers us fitting examples for imitation Between the liturgical year celebrating the life of Christ and the Saints we find a beautiful harmony of how to live out the life of Christ in our own lives Weekend of December 7th 8th 500 Mike Morrissey 730 David Smith 1000 Jay Crisp 500 Ellie Coyne 730 Bruce Holland 1000 Monica Harris 500 Jill Morrissey 730 Volunteer 1000 Rick Singer Jacque
