learning of our summer program Bishop shared with me how glad he was that we started this program special Thank You to all those who helped to organize and volunteered to help make this program happen Did You Know Holy Water Sacrament is an outward sign instituted by Jesus Christ to give grace sacramental on the other hand is anything set apart or blessed by the Church to excite good thoughts to increase devotion and to point us towards the Sacraments and Jesus Christ Holy water is arguably the most well known sacramental from the Catholic Church As a sacramental it points us towards the Sacrament of Baptism Every time we sign our foreheads with holy water we are reminded of our holy baptismal promises and of the obligation then undertaken to keep our souls pure and clean from sin The use of Holy Water in the Catholic Church is a time honored custom In the first centuries it was usual to sprinkle the faithful with holy water in Mass Church Fathers in the 4th Century make mention of a basin or other receptacle containing holy water which stood at the entrance of churches for the use of the Faithful In the 5th Century St John Chrysostom relates that the Faithful used to take holy water to their houses and keep it throughout the year Even today when we enter the Church building we are invited to take holy water from the font which is placed at the door and mark ourselves with the sign of the cross This reminds us of our baptism and that we are called to approach the throne of the Most High with a soul free from sin Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday
