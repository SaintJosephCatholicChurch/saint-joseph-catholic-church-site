  "text": "IFTH UNDAY ASTER AY 2 2021 Congratulations to our First Holy Communicants Wyatt Charlene Olivia James Luke and Lucas on receiving their First Holy Communion this weekend May the grace of Holy Communion help them to grow in the love of God each and every day of their lives And may the joy that they receive in this Sacrament serve as a source of renewal for our own joy in being able to approach our Lord in Holy Communion Our Easter joy continues Christ is risen Truly He is risen Entering this weekend May 1st 2nd into the Fifth Sunday of Easter we are just beyond the midpoint of our celebration Our joy continues through Ascension Thursday forty days after Easter Day until Pentecost Sunday which falls fifty days after Easter Day Throughout these fifty days we continue to celebrate that Jesus has conquered death and proclaimed life to the world This extended celebration of Easter is one that is traced to the first days of the Church St Ambrose the 4th Century Bishop of Milan states that our ancestors have taught us to celebrate the fifty days till Pentecost as a continuation of Easter All these fifty days are like so many Sundays These continued days remind the Christian of that for which they hope To share in the resurrection of Jesus Christ for all eternity This extended celebration is reflected even in our church decorations themselves Though the blooms of our Easter Lilies have faded away and been clipped peacock feathers have sprouted amidst the remaining lilies Both the Easter Lily and the Peacock Feather have served over the years as a sign to Christians of the resurrection and eternal life This is why they are seen adorning the Church throughout the Easter season ARISH OUNCIL OMINATIONS Our Parish Council will have their monthly meeting this Wednesday The Parish Council serves as an advisory board to help in the administration and governance of our parish At our monthly meetings we discuss upcoming events and the overall life and direction of the parish For the past three years our sixmember Parish Council has served as a tremendous help to me since being installed as pastor of St Joseph At this time we are now ready to begin a rotating Parish Council In this model each council member is asked to serve a threeyear term This means that every year two of our existing council members will retire and two new members will be added This both allows a variety of voices to be heard on the council and does not allow the council to become an overly burdensome obligation for its members At the end of the month two of our longstanding council members will be retiring David Huss and Michael Lautzenheiser Both have served for the past three years as well as for a number of years in the past under many of our previous pastors I thank them for their dedication to our parish and their assistance to me over the past three years Later this month we will open nominations for the Parish Council You may nominate yourself or any other parishioner Once nominations are received I will contact all those nominated to ensure that they accept At the end of the month we will entrust the decision to the Holy Spirit as we draw the names of our two new Parish Council members I ask that you discern whether God may be calling you to serve on the Parish Council at this time Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday
