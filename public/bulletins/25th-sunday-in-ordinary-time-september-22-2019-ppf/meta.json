Saturday October 5th following the 5 PM Vigil Mass The Picnic will be potluck style with the parish providing the meat and the drinks and each family bringing a sidedish to share if possible There will be a Chili CookOff games for children of all ages Euchre Bean Bags and much more I look forward to seeing you there Along with the fun and games there will also be a Rectory Open House during the picnic Over the past year Ive often heard how many have not had a chance to see the inside of the Rectory for some time The Rectory is where the priest lives but has also served as the parish office and parish meeting space in the past After our picnic dinner and as games are starting I thought it would be fun to hold an Open House at the Rectory 7730 PM for those interested and invite you in to see my home Two common questions that Ive received over the past year especially in these warmer months is What are you wearing Isnt that hot To answer those questions in order The garment is called a cassock and an emphatic Yes as it can be quite warm at times Diocesan priests often wear two types of garments outside of the liturgy Clerical Suit andor a Cassock The Clerical Suit as worn today consists of black dress pants a black cleri cal shirt and often a suit jacket It has developed over the past 150 years to serve as both modern yet distinguishing clothing to be worn by clergy In warmer climates such as Africa you may also see different color clerical shirts being worn due to the heat The Cassock is the long black garment that developed from the tunic commonly worn in ancient Rome Even as the Roman tunic began to change in style starting in the 6th Century the Cassock remained the general garb worn by diocesan clergy throughout the centuries Both of these garments are worn by priests to serve as a witness to Jesus Christ present in the world Every part of our lives spoken and unspoken is meant to proclaim Christ to the world Both garments share the Roman Collar the white neck band partially covered with black cloth Spiritually this collar reminds everyone who sees it that the light of Christ shines in the darkness and the darkness will not overcome it John 15 It is also a reminder that priests are always available to serve the needs of those around him The priest is not his own his very life serves as a visible sign of Jesus Christ present to us in the midst of everyday life The Cassock often also has three additional symbols along with the Roman Collar There are 33 buttons from the collar to the toe to mark the 33 years that our Blessed Lord and Savior walked upon this earth On each sleeve there are 5 buttons to mark the 5 sacred wounds that our Blessed Lord and Savior suffered upon the Cross the nail marks in both of His hands and feet and His wounded side from which He was pierced with the centurions lance Finally being a long tunic it is very easy to trip on the hem of the garment and fall if one is not paying attention to where they are walking In the same way it is easy to fall into temptation and sin in the spiritual life if we do not pay attention to the road we are walking As such we must always be alert and mindful of every step that we take Mark 1333 1 Peter 58 Colossians 42 To seek after Jesus Christ means to intentionally seek Him out in all things Every aspect of our life must be given over to God For a priest this can also mean wearing something a bit uncomfortable It is a daily personal reminder of our death to self and a chance to unite our suffering both great and small with the Lord As Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI often said The world offers you comfort But you were not made for comfort You were made for greatness Every day of our lives is a chance to live intentionally for Jesus Christ How will we live for Him today Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF SEPTEMBER 2829 2019 CANTORS 500 Jay Crisp 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Sophia Emrah LECTORS 500 Ginny Fenstermaker 730 Carol Butler 1000 PattiClark Johnson
