  "text": "ECOND UNDAY OF DVENT ECEMBER 5 2021 This Wednesday December 8th the Church celebrates our countrys patronal feast The Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception This day is a Holy Day of Obligation To assist in fulfilling this obligation Masses for the Holy Day will be offered on Tuesday December 7th at 5:30PM and Wednesday December 8th at 7:00AM Noon and 7:00PM with Choir This weekend December 4th 5th the Church celebrates the Second Sunday of Advent In our readings we hear the theme of movement and conversion In our first reading Baruch 519 Baruch speaks of the end of the diaspora Israels exile and the return of the Israelites to Jerusalem Similarly our responsorial psalm Psalm 126 is a song rejoicing in the return from exile Though they have returned the journey had only begun in their desire to restore Jerusalem to its former glory In our second reading Philippians 146 811St Paul speaks to the Church in Philippi This Roman town occupied by both Gentiles and a small Jewish community had embraced the Lord Though he is imprisoned as he writes them he rejoices with those in Philippi about the great growth the Church had seen As great as the growth had been he prays that their relationship with and their conversion in Christ continues to deepen Finally this call is echoed again in our Gospel Luke 316 as St John the Baptist calls all people to repentance Israel responds to his call as those from within and without the cities go out into the desert to encounter him John though is only preparing the way for something someone greater Jesus Christ The best gift that we can give to Jesus this Christmas is the gift of our conversion And the best way for us to receive this gift from Jesus is in the sacramental form in which He wishes to give it
