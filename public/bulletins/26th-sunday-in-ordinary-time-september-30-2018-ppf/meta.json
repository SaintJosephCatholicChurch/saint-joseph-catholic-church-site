in Ordinary Time September 30 2018 Year Pictured to the side is a photo from the Chapel of St Stephen in St Paul outside the Walls one of the four major basilicas in Rome Upon our arrival on Monday my fellow pilgrims and I made the trek to St Pauls and to begin our time in Rome offered Mass at this altar I offered this Mass for our parish families and members as well as the many specials intentions that I was asked to pray for during this time Each day we will have the chance to offer Mass at a different holy site These intentions have and will remain with me as we travel to the other major basilicas and churches throughout the city As I write this it is currently a brisk evening and I am sitting outside of St Peters Basilica This morning I sat just a few feet from the Altar of the Chair one of the main altars in St Peters and concelebrated the ordination Mass for the 40 men or dained to the diaconate for our country including our own Dcn Spenser St Louis Now I am sitting against a small pillar as hundreds of people are milling about the square praying talking taking photos Next to me is a giant obelisk once a sign of pagan Romes greatness Now atop the obelisk sits the Cross of Jesus Christ who must renew all things Even as the sun has set there is a glow in the face of every per son who passes by The love of Christ the great majesty and awe of His presence in this place cannot help but touch the lives of everyone who passes by in one way or another In moments like these I feel a glimpse of understanding of what the Scrip tures speak of when it is said that hope springs eternal In our readings today we hear from the Book of Numbers This is one of four times that we hear from this book in our entire threeyear cycle of Sunday readings And in this reading Moses speaks against the sin of envy The Spirit shared with the elders is given freely by God Even when it is given in ways or to persons that we would not expect God will still use these ways and persons to bring about His good Jesus continues this lesson in our Gospel reading The Apostles jealous at one per forming works that they themselves could not do desire to stop this person And the Lord in turn rebukes them and reminds them that all things done in His name can work for the good if we will allow them too Moreso He continues those things that can truly separate us from Himself are those things that we pursue even good things become ends in themselves They no longer feed our desire for God but become that which desire Because of this these things the Lord says in no uncertain terms must be cut out from our lives Our second reading gains a new context within our Gospel Anything that can keep us from falling deeper and deeper in love with Jesus Christ is useless to us Putting our hopes in such things will only leave us miserable We seek not worldly happiness which is passing away but eternal joy and beatitude This morning as those 40 young men laid down in front of the altar they laid down their lives for Christ They are to spend the rest of their lives seeking Christ in all things This will at times be a very painful path and one fraught with many chances to go astray Yet as that Cross that now sits atop the obelisk right next to me testifies Christ will prevail He will overcome and renew all things He will always call us home to Him and His Church to be renewed Of this our faith assured us What things keep us from Christ today How can we remove these things from our lives What concrete step can we take to be one step closer to Christ today In Christ Fr David
