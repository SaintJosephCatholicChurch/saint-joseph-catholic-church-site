<p>Proceeds supports Coats for Kids Program. The Knights of Columbus developed the Coats for Kids program, which allows councils across North America the opportunity to put their faith into action and purchase new winter coats at a discount for children in need in their communities. More than 500,000 new winter coats have been distributed throughout the United States and Canada since the program began in 2009.</p>
<p>Locally, the council at St. Joseph Bluffton has donated winter coats to each of the Wells County schools over the last several years. Most recently, coats have also been donated to Family Centered Services in Bluffton.</p>
<p>The Coats for Kids program is one of many programs that support the Knights of Columbus principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism. Thank you for your support.</p>
