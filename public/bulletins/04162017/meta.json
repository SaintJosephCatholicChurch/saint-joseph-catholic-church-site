James Yonker Sr Priscilla Rogers Evelyn Morrissey Betty Meyer Ron Payne David Carr Larry Dustman Ronnie Bonnie Burns Gary Cook Michael Green and George Bitzer THE RESURRECTION OF THE LORD EASTER SUNDAY APRIL 16TH 2017 YR ABC From the Pastors Desk TODAY IS EASTER SUNDAY THE DAY THE LORD JESUS CHRIST ROSE FROM DEATH WE ARE CELEBRATING GODS LOVE AND CHRISTS LOVE FOR HUMANITY YES GODS LOVE FOR YOU AND ME CHRISTS LOVE FOR US AND YOUR LOVE FOR YOUR NEIGHBOUR WE NEED TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER SO THAT IN LOVE WE RISE TO EVER LASTING BLESSEDNESS TO EN JOY THE LIFE OF RESURRECTION My dear brothers and sisters in the Lord rejoice as we celebrate the Resurrection of the Lord Easter I want to congratulate Britteny Cerna who received the Sacraments of Initiation last night Baptism Confirmation and the Holy Communion I want also to congratulate our Confirmation Candidates Grayson Christal Quinn Dreiband Sophia Emrah Danika Harris Andrew Hartman Brittney Ho Faith Loshe Justin Mayer Bren dan McCorkle Juan Ortiz Marco Sanchez Kendall Smith who will be confirmed on Friday April 21 2017 and Randy Anderson who receives the Confirmation at St Alo ysius It is a wonderful thing that they receive this all important Sacrament of Confir mation as we are celebrating the Resurrection of the Lord The Resurrection is what we are celebrating today It is Easter The life of love in Christ Jesus when our mortal bodies will take on immortality the corruptible bodies will take on incorruptibility the perishable bodies will take on imperishability and then we will take on glorified bodies What we are celebrating is not fairy tale but a historical fact as we read in the 1st reading Act 1034a 3743 You must have heard about the recent happening in Judea about Jesus of Nazareth and how He went about doing good and to the fact that They killed Him by hanging Him on a tree yet three days afterwards God raised Him to life and allowed Him to be seen Now we are those witnesses we ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead and He has ordered us to proclaim this to His people That is you God so loved the world that He gave His Only Son to die for our sake And Christ so loved us that He gave Himself up to death death on the Cross for us Why so such great a love It is because Christ knew that we need His help to be saved and so enjoy the blessedness of God in heaven As the Responsorial Psalm said This day is the day the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad Let us really be happy HAPPY EASTER HAPPY EASTER HAPPY EASTER So we are called to be happy to rejoice to love as God loves to love as we should How The answer is What so ever you do to the least of my people that you do unto me When I was hungry you gave me to eat when I was thirsty you gave me to drink Now enter into the home of my Father It was this love that made Mary Magdalene to go to the tomb early in the morning as we read in the Gospel Jn 2019 And when she did not see the body of the Lord Jesus she ran to Peter The same love made Peter and the disciple the Lord loved that is John to also run to the tomb We are invited to run to the tomb to look for the Lord Jesus We are invited to love one another for Gods sake and for the life of blessedness My dear brothers and sisters in Christ From my personal experience I was in prayer of meditation thanking God for all He did for me so many of them Then I asked Him What I should do for You My Lord Jesus for all these you have done for me For all your love on me He said Love me and care for me in the poor and the needy To love God is to love the poor and the needy around you Help them Do not close your eyes on them Help them Whatever you give to the poor and the needy you really re serve them for yourself in heaven That is In your heavenly bank account Love and give so that love will be shown to you and gifts be given to you Alleluia God bless you Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it HAPPY
