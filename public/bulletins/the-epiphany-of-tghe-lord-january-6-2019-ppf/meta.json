The Baptism of the Lord Is 401 5911 Ti 21114 347 Lk 315162122 The Epiphany of the Lord January 6 2019 Year As we begin the twelfth day of Christmas the Church celebrates the Feast of the Epiphany of the Lord On this day we continue to commemorate the manifestation of Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Saviour of the whole world This manifesta tion of Jesus Christ is reflected through our readings most especially from the familiar story of the Magi from the Gospel of St Matthew With the Magis adoration of the Christchild we find the whole world Jew the Shepherds and Gentile the Magi alike coming before and recognizing the Lord In His Incarnation the good news of salvation has been manifested to the world As Jesus Christ is revealed and manifested to us in the Christmas season we as His followers are called to manifest Him and His Church to the whole world at all times And just as the Magi sought out to welcome the Christchild we are called to welcome Him into our lives and our homes The practice of the Epiphany Home Blessing is a chance for us to both invite Christ into our homes and to serve as a form of evangelization to every person that crosses the threshold of our homes At the end of each Mass this weekend Epiphany Chalk will be blessed and available to take home in the back of the church I invite and encourage you to make use of this sacramental to bless your home as detailed in the instructions included with the Epiphany Chalk The chalk is used to mark your door frame with this inscription 20 19 The 2019 marks the new year the crosses remind us of the saving cross of our Lord and the CMB stands for both the traditional name asso ciated with the Magi Caspar Melchior and Balthasar as well as serving as an abbre viation for the Latin prayer of Christus mansionem benedicat or May Christ bless this house May this marking serve as a constant remind both to ourselves and to every guest that we as Catholic entrust our homes and our families to God In our first reading Isaiah 6016 we hear of how Israel will be an instrument for the Lord with the coming of the Messiah As Gods chosen people they will be ex alted as a shining example of Gods grace for all to see And with their glory made prominent Israel is meant to draw all nations to follow after God This passage serves as a beacon of hope to an Israel that is itself under foreign rulers and is struggling to rebuild Jerusalem and the Temple after return from the Babylonian exile St Matthew alludes to these very verses in our Gospel today Matthew 2112 as being fulfilled in the adoration of the Magi as these foreigners come bearing gifts With the coming of the Magi the salvific message of God breaks forth to the entire world Their prostration and worship to the Christchild shows that the Magi un derstood that Jesus was not simply the ruler of the nation of Israel but someone greater As St Paul the Apostle to the Gentiles reaffirms in our second reading Ephesians 32 6 Jesus Christ as saviour of the world has been revealed to us As followers of Christ we minister as members of His body here on earth May we take this message out to all the world so that all people may know our joy true joy of the priesthood is that every time a priest moves to a parish his family grows Each parishioner is a member of that family Several parishioners have recently asked me about the best way to invite me over to their homes The chance to visit with each of you and to spend time with you and your families is one of the greatest bless ings of my life As such I always try to accept invitations when offered and if I have a previous engagement will always work with you to find a time that will work The best way to find a time when we would be able to visit is to either call the parish office or email me at <a href=\"frdavidvioligmail.com\">frdavidvioligmail.com</a> Fr David Let all that you do be done with love 1 Corinthians 1614 WEEKEND OF January 1213 2019 CANTORS 500
