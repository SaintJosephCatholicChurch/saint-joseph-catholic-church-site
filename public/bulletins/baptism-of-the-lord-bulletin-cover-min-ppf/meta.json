school know of our prayers for you as you begin this new semester May our Blessed Lord and St Thomas Aquinas Patron Saint of Students guide you in your studies Today the Church celebrates the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord This brings an end to the liturgical Christmas Season and on Monday brings us anew into the First Week of Ordinary Time This new season meditates upon the quiet years of the life of our Lord from His birth on Christmas Day to the beginning of His public ministry before leading us into Lent on Ash Wednesday As we enter into Ordinary Time our Christmas decorations and Nativity scene within the Church will be taken down and stored away until next year We will however see a brief resurgence of the Christmas season on February 2nd as we celebrate the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord often referred to as Candlemas Candlemas marks the fortieth day after Christmas Day and as is the Jewish custom of Leviticus 1214 was the day that Jesus was dedicated by our Blessed Mother and St Joseph in the Temple Luke 22138 Prior to Pope St Paul VIs revision of the liturgical calendar in 1969 Candlemas served as the liturgical end of the Christmas season Following a tradition we kept in the seminary I will be leaving the rectory Christmas lights up until February 2nd At the end of the day praying Compline or Night Prayer by the light of the Christmas tree in the rectory living room is always peaceful so I dont mind extending that time as long as possible General Parish and Rectory Updates With the many improvements and upgrades to our campus this past year we are beginning to see an increased use of parish buildings With the approval of our Parish Council local ABC Studio Activity Center will be renting the parish gym twice a week over the next four months while they are transitioning to move to a larger location We have also approved use of the gym for a weekly pickup basketball league This noncompetitive league will begin to meet on Mondays in March and will be open to adults 18 of all skill levels More information will be provided in the coming weeks Following the Rectory Open House at the Parish Picnic Ive been asked by many parishioners if I would be updating the Rectory anytime soon As with any home the Rectory requires general maintenance and upkeep Now that Ive had a chance to settle in over the past year and a half I will be doing some work to ensure that the Rectory is kept upto date and in good order One major update will be to the rectory carpet which has served well over the past several decades but is fairly worn down and in need of replacement In the coming months I will be looking at updating the flooring in the main living areas while also sprucing up the paint in most rooms Once updates are made I look forward to hosting another Open House in the future Our January Book Study of Jimmy Akins The Bible is a Catholic Book continues this Thursday at 7 PM in the Parish Conference Room To accommodate those who will be attending the ALPHA Series beginning this Thursday from 6308 PM at Family Centered Services we will offer a second time for the book study with a second meeting offered this Friday January 17th at
