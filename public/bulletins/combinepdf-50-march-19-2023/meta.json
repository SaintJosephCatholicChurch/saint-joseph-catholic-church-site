  "text": "Fourth Sunday of Lent Laetare Sunday March 19 2023 This weekend March 18th 19th the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday of Lent or Laetare Sunday This name is taken from today's entrance antiphon Laetare Jerusalem or Rejoice Jerusalem and is meant to encourage us as we persevere fervently to the end of this holy Season For today the Church not only permits but even bids her children to rejoice as Christ is near Emphasizing this joy rose is worn a mixture of violet and gold flowers are in the Sanctuary and we lift our voices once again for a closing hymn as we go forth rejoicing It is at this time of the season that we are now at the halfway point of Lent For some this may be a moment of accomplishment and a time to double down on our Lenten commitments For others this is the perfect time to refocus and re strategize to make this last half better than the first No matter how our Lent is going we do not want to lose hope for the love of Christ is our end goal As we move towards the love of Christ all of the struggles that we may face throughout this Lenten season will help to make our Easter more edifying In the words of St John Vianney patron saint of priests You must accept your cross If you bear it courageously it will carry you to heaven This Lent let us not flee from or fear the cross but carry it with love and hope seeing it as it truly is in Christ The means not of death but of eternal life Starting next week entering into Passiontide the images and crosses in our church and maybe even in your homes and other places of prayer will be veiled from our sight They will remain veiled until the great unveiling of the crucified on Good Friday when the Church calls out for us to behold the wood of the cross whereon was hung the world's salvation Then out of the darkness of that night and the twilight of Holy Saturday new light springs out of the darkness of that great night when hell is conquered and man is reconciled to God In addition to the joy of Laetare Sunday we as a parish have an additional reason to celebrate Sunday March 19th marks the Solemnity of St Joseph Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary Though this celebration is eclipsed by the Fourth Sunday of Lent we are still called to rejoice in this day dedicated to our parish patron St Joseph He who was entrusted with the earthly protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary and our Lord Jesus Christ continues to watch over and guard the earthly body of His Son which is the Church Now from heaven with our Lord St Joseph exercises a powerful protection over those that invoke him Upcoming Lenten Events Though we are at the mid way point of Lent there are still a number of events that are quickly approaching to aid in the remainder of our Lenten journey This coming Saturday March 25th we are offering our Parish Lenten Retreat which is a day 9 AM 2 PM set apart for prayer adoration and fraternity Our retreat speaker Bob Kloska has been appointed by Bishop Rhoades as one of our
