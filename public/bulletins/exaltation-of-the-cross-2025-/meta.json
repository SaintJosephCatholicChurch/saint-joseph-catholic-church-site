Church celebrates the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross On September 13 335 the Church of the Holy Sepulcher also called the Church of the Resurrection was dedicated The following day the cross that Empress Helena had discovered on September 14 320 was venerated in a solemn ceremony This feast day today connects these two solemn events in history Being Christian Pope Benedict XVI writes is not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea but the encounter with an event The Gospel that the liturgy offers us on the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross suggests that God wants to enter into a relationship of love with everyone This is offered in His Son Jesus lifted up on the Cross Lifting up our gaze to God expresses a very important truth we are invited to enter back into relationship with Him We need to stop turning in on ourselves uselessly nurturing a sense of guilt and forgetting that in whatever our hearts condemn God is greater than our hearts 1 Jn 320 Let us lift up our eyes toward the stars remember Abraham and the promise of many descendants knowing how to cast every worry onto God Lifting up our gaze should not enkindle fear but gratitude because that elevation is the measure of the love with which God loves His children in His Son It is the Mercy of God therefore which as is the case with Nicodemus illuminates the darkness of our lives and allows us to continue on our journey We cannot remain neutral regarding the Cross of Jesus Either we are with Him or we are against Him choice is made before every action for the actions of a Christian are none other than the testimony of how God has love us so much that he gave His only Son Jesus Church Renovation Update When we received the bids for our renovation work in mid August we submitted them to our diocesan Building and Improvements Committee This committee serves as a review board for all major projects and offers guidance to parishes in choosing which bid proposal to go with This past Thursday we heard back from the committee and have received the go ahead to accept the bid proposal from Shawnee Construction based in Fort Wayne We are now having contracts drawn up to bring Shawnee Construction on board as our general contractor for this project Once these contracts are signed off we will be sitting down with them and our architectural firm to begin looking at specifics and setting time tables Thankfully this means that we have now completed the preparatory phase of this process and have all needed approvals from our diocesan committees to move forward 39th
