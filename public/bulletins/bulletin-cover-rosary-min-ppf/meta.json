  "text": "ECOND UNDAY OF DVENT ECEMBER 6 2020 special Thank You to Andy Vachon and FAL Electric Co Inc for all their hard work in installing our sanctuary lights These new fixtures not only allow for greater versatility in our lighting design eg the beautiful way that the tabernacle is now lit but are also more efficient and will require less maintenance than the previous fixtures This weekend Dec 56 we enter the 2nd Sunday of Advent Having entered into our new liturgical year last weekend we will primarily spend this coming year walking with our Lord through the Gospel of St Mark In the very middle of this liturgical year we will have a brief detour from St Marks Gospel as we spend several weeks on the Bread of Life Discourse from the sixth chapter of St Johns Gospel Being in the 2nd of a three year cycle this means that the Church centers our 3year reflection of the Sacred Scriptures on the Most Holy Eucharist Much in the same way as we are reflecting on this weekend we see that the Sacred Scriptures as we hear in our liturgy is meant to prepare us to receive Jesus Christ in the Most Holy Eucharist The word of God prepares our hearts to receive the very Word of God Himself Jesus Christ Everything that we do is meant to call us into this intimate relationship with our Lord The Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary falls this coming Tuesday Dec 8th Though this is a yearly Holy Day the obligation to attend the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass on this day remains dispensed by Bishop Rhoades due to COVID19 Though not a Holy Day of Obligation this year may we see it as a holy day of opportunity For those able to join us in person Mass will be offered on Tuesday Dec 8th at 8:00AM Noon and 7:00PM The 7:00PM Mass is offered as a part of our Advent Parish Mission as we welcome Fr Stephen Felicichia as the homilist Speaking of our Advent Parish Mission it starts this Monday Dont forget to join us Monday Dec 7th Wednesday Dec 9th each evening from
