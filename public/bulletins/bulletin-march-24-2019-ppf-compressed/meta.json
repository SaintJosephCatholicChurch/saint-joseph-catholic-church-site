Hos 616 Lk 18914 Sun Mar 31 Fourth Sunday of Lent Jos 59a1012 2 Cor 51721 Lk 15131132 THIRD SUNDAY OF LENT MARCH 24 2019 special Thank You to all those who assisted in our St Josephs Day celebrations May we find in St Joseph our patron a strong protector and powerful intercessor be fore our Lord Jesus Christ Within the 3rd Sunday of Lent we begin the first of the three Scrutinies of our Elect and Candidates for Full Communion The Scrutinies come from an ancient practice in the Church of preparing those to be baptized by uncovering then healing all that is weak defective or sinful in the hearts of the elect and to bring out then strengthen all that is upright strong and good Rites of Christian Initiation of Adults no 141 This practice was first recorded by St Hippolytus of Rome in his 2nd Century text The Apostolic Tradition Over these next three Sundays we will invite forward our Elect Brady and our Candidates for Full Communion Diane and Diane as we invoke our Lord to strengthen them in this time of preparation and to increase their faith and deepen their and our conversion Together with them we joyfully await that most solemn of nights as we pre pare to rejoice together in the Resurrection of our Lord at the Easter Vigil During the Scrutinies we will deviate from our Year Readings and make use of the Year Readings at the Masses in which we call forward our Elect and Candidates for Full Communion The Year Readings over the next three weeks The Samaritan Woman at the Well The Man Born Blind The Death of Lazarus offer a special focus on this call to conversion made to those preparing to enter fully into the Church and are referenced directly in the Scrutinies Just as our Elect and our Candidates for Full Communion are called to conver sion so is each and every one of us Our readings from Year call us to this same con version and repentance As God has revealed Himself to Moses through the burning bush so He continues to reveal Himself to us today We find Him in the Eucharist in His Church and in one another But though we meet Him daily we like the Israelites that St Paul speaks of can still turn away from Him Our journey with the Lord is one to be renewed each and every day of our lives In this Lenten season He wishes to reclaim our hearts and to place Himself at the center of our lives His patience knows no bounds and He like the gardener will do everything in His power to provide us with that which we will need to flourish No matter how far away we may have gone the Lord always calls us to return to Himself and to bear fruit The Lord loves us intensely May we al ways love Him back in return Next Sunday will mark Laetare Sunday or Rejoice Sunday as we enter the fourth week of Lent This halfway point of the Lenten season is a good time to renew our commitment to our Lenten observances and if we have not yet had a chance to do so to make use of the Sacrament of Confession To help ensure that the Sacrament of Confession is made as available as possible I will be available in the confessional for our Blue Light Special after all weekend Masses during Laetare Sunday Confession is also available every Tuesday from 8309 AM every Wednesday from 6645 PM and every Saturday from 4445 PM Our Parish Penance Service will be Monday April 8 from 730830 PM If these various times do not work with your schedule I will always do what I
