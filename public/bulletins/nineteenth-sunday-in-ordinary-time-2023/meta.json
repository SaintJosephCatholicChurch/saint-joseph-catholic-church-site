  "text": "Nineteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time August 13 2023 This weekend Aug 12th 13th the Church celebrates the Nineteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our bulletin cover however reflects the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary celebrated this Tuesday August 15th As this solemnity is a Holy Day of Obligation we are offering several Mass times to assist in meeting this obligation Mass Times for the Solemnity of the Assumption Vigil Mass on Monday August 14th at 7 PM Mass on Tuesday August 15th at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM Though the dogma of the Assumption was only recently formally declared by Pope Pius XII in 1950 the teaching itself can be traced back to the first centuries of the Church By the beginning of the fourth century a church was built to mark the already celebrated ancient empty Tomb of Mary near Mount Zion This feast day was almost universally celebrated in the Eastern Church by 336 AD and by the Western or Roman Church by the sixth century In the middle of the fifth century the Patriarch of Jerusalem St Juvenal was asked by the Emperor Marcian to bring a relic of the Blessed Virgin Mary to the Council of Chalcedon The Patriarch responded that he could not as there were no relics of the Blessed Virgin He explained that Mary had died in the presence of the Apostles Her closed tomb when opened at the request of St Thomas the Apostle however was found empty From this the Apostles knew that Mary's body had been assumed into heaven Parish Council This past week our Parish Council resumed its meetings for the year We are welcome our two new Parish Council members this year Lori Bender and Tyler Hoffacker These two drawn from over 20 nominations join our current Parish Council members Chris Hartman Abraham Herr Sarah McCorkle and Andy Vachon in serving as an advisory board for our parish The Parish Council meets on the first Wednesday of every month after the 7 PM evening Mass in the Parish Conference Room and is open for all parishioners to attend St Francis Summer Reading Program Last weekend marked the end of our St Francis Summer Reading Program Over the past two months twenty four of our youth read over 8000 pages from a collection of our faith based books Congratulations to our first place winners Landon in the Elementary Category and Cecelia in the MiddleHigh School Category and all those who participated Lifewise Academy number have asked my opinion of the Lifewise Academy Program now being offered in two of our school districts Over the past year our diocesan Office of Catechesis and I have been in talks with various representatives of Lifewise Academy regarding concerns with their program's curriculum Though we have raised several concerns regarding the curriculum we have so far received little receptivity for actual dialogue regarding these concerns In brief the organization and the curriculum it uses are presented as being non denominational Yet the organization itself puts forward a Statement of Beliefs and its core curriculum is purchased from an outreach of the Southern Baptist Convention We found a number of their Statements of Beliefs ten of seventeen statements to be at odds with the teachings of the Catholic Church In addition to this the limited number of lesson plans we were permitted to preview from their curriculum have raised similar concerns As pastor of our parish I would strongly encourage our parish families to refrain from enrolling in this specific program I will be sending a letter to our school aged families highlighting some of the specific concerns that were touched on in a general way in this column While the desire to infuse the Scriptures into daily life is one to be lauded how these lessons are presented are of great importance to avoid confusion and misconceptions Saturday August 12 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am Confession 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Herbert Genevieve Lohmuller Family Sunday August 13 Nineteenth Sunday in
