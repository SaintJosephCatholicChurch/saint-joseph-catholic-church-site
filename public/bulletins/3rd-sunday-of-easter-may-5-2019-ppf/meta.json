to our Social Committee and all those volunteers who assisted at the Easter Egg Hunt this past weekend It was a wonderful parish event and I hope that we can look forward to it becoming an annual tradition This weekend we celebrate with great joy the First Holy Communion of ten of our young parishioners special Congratulations to these ten young men and women These ten have spent the past many months in our Religious Education pro gram preparing for this wonderful day May we rejoice with them as a parish family and keep them and their families in our prayers May we also use this moment as a chance to recall our own First Holy Communion when we first received the Lord in the Eucharist The Eucharist which is the Bread of Life is a treasure whose value cannot be measured In it we receive Christ Himself and in receiving Him are transfigured ever more closely into His Mystical Body Every time that we present ourselves to re ceive our Eucharistic Lord may we become ever more united to Him whom we receive In receiving our Lord in His Body and Blood we must become like the Apos tles in our first reading Acts 52732 4041 Their love for the Lord cannot be con tained and they go throughout Jerusalem preaching His name We must do the same in our everyday lives We must as the Psalmist says praise Him who has rescued us And as St John describes in our second reading Revelation 51114 our cries of praise are united to the eternal worship of God found in the Heavenly Liturgy The praises of the Church Militant we here on earth are united with the Church Trium phant the Communion of Saints in Heaven and the Church Suffering those undergo ing purgation May the joy of our First Communions this weekend serve to renew our own joy in receiving our Lord in the Eucharist and keep His praises always on our lips This weekend we also celebrating May Crowning where we honor the Blessed Virgin Mother of our Lord as the Queen of May As Pope St John Paul II described the wonderful tradition of May Crowning The queen symbol was attributed to Mary because she was a perfect follower of Christ who is the absolute crown of creation Though dedicating the month of May to the Blessed Virgin is a more recent tradition most likely arising in the early 19th Century devotion to the Blessed Virgin is traced back to the earliest days of the Church I encourage each family to dedicate this month to our Blessed Mother by a daily recitation of the Holy Rosary Continue to pray the Rosary everyday and you will never be led astray from Jesus and Mary Reminder Our Discussion Forum next weekend will look at Marys role in the Church As previously mentioned I will be away from our parish for a part of the sum mer At Bishop Rhoades request I am pursuing further studies over the next four years in Canon Law at the Catholic University of America CUA in Washington DC I will formally be away from our parish for classes starting Saturday June 1st and will return to St Josephs on Saturday August 3rd During the remainder of the year I will be com pleting courses online through CUA while remaining of course as pastor here at St Josephs During both June and July a priest will be assigned by Bishop Rhoades to remain at St Josephs and assist with Masses emergencies and all sacramental needs Come August I would like to begin the process of formulating a five year plan for our parish five year plan allows us to ask ourselves where we as a parish are going and how can we continue the good work that is happening here at St Joseph To start this process we will begin to update our parish census over the summer Then once I return in August we will hold town hall meetings after all Masses one weekend This will allow me the great opportunity to have a chance to hear from you and for us as a parish family to discuss a variety of topics I look forward to working closely with our various committees and each of you as we plan for our parishs future Information will be included in the bulletin as we move closer to the summer months In Christ Fr David Lord help me to remember that nothing is going to happen to me today that you and I together cant handle Amen WEEKEND
