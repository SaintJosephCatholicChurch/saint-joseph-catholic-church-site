reality of unavoidable conditions of sickness pain suffering and death in human existence We were encouraged to cope with them since we cannot change or avoid them In todays Liturgy the readings especially in the first reading and the Gospel we are faced with the problem of leprosy in some parts of the world We can realize that separation rejection caused by leprosy can be very painful and devastating in life Over the centuries in the olden days lep rosy has no cure Its victims are sent out of their community ostracized and rejected Even today in some of the developing countries there are still thousands of people who suffer this terrible contagious and dangerous illness In the first reading Lv 1312 4446 leper was shouting Unclean unclean as heshe goes along the road for he she is unclean He is to separate himselfherself from his community and live outside the campvillagetown He is untouchable un clean and rejected Lepers remained in this condition until they are cured but in most cases most of them died in such horrible sad conditions for there was no easy known means of curing them In the Gospel Mk 14045 leper again came to Jesus kneeling at His feet and passionately pleaded with Him If you wish you can make me clean Jesus knowing the horrible condition of this man was moved with pity concern and love stretched out his hand touched him and said I do will it Be made clean The leprosy left him immediately and he was made clean You can imagine how happy this man must be for being set free from rejection disgrace separation from his family wife children friends and community Jesus manifested the powerful healing love and mercy of God Our Almighty loving God Let us thank Him for this leper and for all He has been doing for us Though the Lord Jesus warned him not to tell anyone about his cure He could not keep his mouth shut but joyfully broadcasted it all over the place Let us look at this scenery at another level The uncleanness of the skin caused by lep rosy can be compared to the uncleanness of the soul caused by sin What leprosy does on the human body is what sin does in human soul Lepers are unhappy and sinners are unhappy too or should be unhappy Sin causes spiritual leprosy Spiritual leprosy is more dangerous than bodily leprosy We must do our best to avoid spiritual leprosy That is why it is necessary that we should as soon as we know that we have committed any sin we must quickly go to the priest for confession to be cleansed from our sins The amount needed each week to make budget is 511640 We are 7113 ahead of budget from last week
