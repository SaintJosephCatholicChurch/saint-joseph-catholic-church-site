April 23rd 24th the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday of Easter This weekend is often referred to as Good Shepherd Sunday and more recently Vocation Sunday As we hear the Gospel reading of the Good Shepherd on this liturgical day Pope St Paul VI in 1964 established today as the World Day of Prayer for Vocations The purpose of this day is to fulfill the Lords instruction to Pray the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into his harvest Matthew 938 Luke 102 Given our weekends vocational theme and with our hymnals back in the pews we will resume our weekly parish prayer for vocations found on the inside of our hymnals This prayer not only prays for an increase in holy marriages and the dedicated single life but in a special way asks the Lord to raise up vocations to both priesthood and religious life from within our own parish As a parish we are called to not only serve as witnesses to these various vocations but to encourage our young men and women to pursue their specific vocation with their whole heart Our bulletin cover offers a brief insight into the various vocations each one rooted in the call to holiness that is common to all people In promoting these vocations we first are called to live out our own vocation well life welllived and rooted in the joy of Jesus Christ is often the most attractive witness to the life of holiness Then we are called to promote others in their vocation and encourage our youth to not be afraid in pursuing their vocation life lived for Jesus Christ is a life lived in true joy This is often a joy that is foreign to the secular world as heard in our second reading the world does not know us 1 John 31 It is a joy found in living for something truly someone other than ourselves Or in the words of the Passion of the Christ actor Jim Caviezel to the youth of the world Be saints You were not made to fit in You were born to stand out Following after our vocation in life we truly begin to stand out as true witnesses to Jesus Christ Our vocations our very lives lived well become a testimony to Him The great thing about a vocation is that everyone has one Beginning in that call to holiness we then discern our state in life Priest Religious Married or Single Our state life helps to guide us in how we will best serve God and neighbor How do we help to foster vocations in our youth By striving to be saints ourselves Holiness begets holiness in others By living out our vocations in life with joy we will encourage others to do the same We also pray often for those discerning their vocations fasting and offering sacrifices for their discernment May we never be afraid to pursue that which God calls us to In the words of our Holy Father Pope Francis May Saint Joseph protector of vocations accompany us with his fatherly heart Next weekend our First Holy Communicants will make their First Holy Communion at a special Sunday afternoon Mass Please pray for these our beloved children of God that the grace of Holy Communion will help them to grow in love of God each day Each time they approach the Blessed Sacrament may their love for God be more fervent than the last In turn may the joy of our First Holy Communicants in receiving our Lord in the Holy Eucharist for the first time renew our own zeal in being able to receive Holy Communion Devotion to our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament is itself another way to encourage vocations Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday April 24 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Mark Makowski Sunday April 25 Fourth
