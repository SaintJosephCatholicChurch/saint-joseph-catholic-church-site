  "text": "Second Sunday in Ordinary Time January 15 2023 This weekend January 14th 15th the Church celebrates the Second Sunday in Ordinary Time Though it may seem that we have skipped a week the First Sunday in Ordinary Time is always begun by the last Sunday of our Christmas celebration which is either the Solemnity of the Epiphany or the Baptist of the Lord depending on the liturgical year Therefore we always enter into the season of Ordinary Time in the midst of the weekdays Over the next few weekends our bulletin cover will explore the various names we hear every Sunday as a part of the Roman Canon or Eucharistic Prayer I This Eucharistic Prayer recommended for use on Sundays by the General Instruction of the Roman Missal Paragraph 365 individually names forty one different Saints As we hear these names so often it would seem useful to learn a little more about them About who they are and how their lives on this earth reflected Jesus Christ The Roman Canon is itself the most ancient of the four Eucharistic Prayers Prior to the Second Vatican Council it was the only Eucharistic Prayer in use for nearly 1600 years This prayer gained its familiar structure under Pope St Gregory the Great at the end of the 6th Century Large portions of the prayer are however cited in earlier writings from Pope St Innocent I at the beginning of the 5th Century and St Ambrose in the mid 4th Century These early Church Fathers found the Roman Canon at least in part to be an ancient prayer already in use by the Church in Rome hence the term Roman Canon The very name of Eucharistic Prayer I as the Roman Canon gives us a clue about the various Saints named within it Arising from the Church of Rome the Saints emphasized are those who would have found great devotion from among the Faithful in Rome during the early first centuries In the coming weekends this will become clearer as we see that many of the men and women listed have the distinction of being early Roman Martyrs andor patrons of the city of Rome herself The first names listed in this prayer however are perhaps the most familiar Mary St Joseph and the Apostles The listing of the Apostles does not include the successor to Judas Iscariot St Matthias Acts 112 26 as he is listed among the martyrs in the second part of the Roman Canon It does however include St Paul immediately alongside St Peter Sts Peter and Paul are of course considered as primary patrons saints of the city of Rome Our bulletin cover this weekend includes a listing of the Twelve Apostles and St Paul with a brief biography of each Totus Amoris Est Everything Pertains to Love On the bulletin board in the Narthex you will find a newspaper clipping from last week's Osservatore Romano the official newspaper of the Vatican The newspaper is often used to announce major news regarding canon law which means that I keep a subscription to it and try to glance through it every week In addition to such news it also recounts the weekly activities and speeches of the Holy Father and major Church news throughout the world This past week the newspaper offered a synopsis of Pope Francis latest motu proprio or Apostolic Letter entitled Totus Amoris Est This Apostolic Letter marks the 400th anniversary of the death of St Francis de Sales author of our parish's Christmas gift An Introduction to the Devout Life In it Pope Francis offers a reflection of the importance of the writings of St Francis de Sales both in his own day and to our own modern day Speaking on An Introduction to the Devout Life Pope Francis highlights how devotion is meant for everyone in every situation and each of us can practice it in accordance with our own vocation The Holy Father remarked how St Francis writings emphasized that the Christian life is discovering the joy of loving and the source of this love that attracts the heart is the life of Jesus Christ This Apostolic Letter is now available on our parish website if you wish to read it
