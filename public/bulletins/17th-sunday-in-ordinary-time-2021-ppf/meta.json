  "text": "EVENTEENTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME JULY 25TH 2021 This weekend July 24th 25th the Church celebrates the Seventeenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Earlier this year Pope Francis also dedicated this weekend to be the first annual World Day for Grandparents and the Eldery In this celebration we are called to honor all of our grandparents and the elderly who are so important to our communities and our Church In the inaugural address for this day Pope Francis speaks directly to grandparents and all the elderly reminding us all that there is no retirement age from the work of proclaiming the Gospel and handing down traditions Instead we are called as Jesus Himself tells Nicodemus John 3121 to always open our hearts to the working of the Holy Spirit With this in mind Pope Francis exhorts all grandparents and elderly to take an active part in renewing and supporting our troubled societies In setting this celebration our Holy Father has based it around the feast of Sts Joachim and Anne the parents of the Blessed Virgin and grandparents to our Lord Sts Joachim and Anne are the patron saints of grandparents whose feast is celebrated on July 26th May all grandparents and elderly find friends in these two great saints who have played such an important role in salvation history WELCOME UESTS CN RUCE AND ILL This weekend we are joined by Dcn Bruce Goodwin at both our 7:30AM 10 AM Sunday Masses Dcn Bruce son of the late Carl and Melba Goodwin grew up in our parish for many years Having eventually settled in Atlanta he was ordained to the permanent diaconate this past year for the Archdiocese of Atlanta He is visiting with us this weekend as he is in town for his high school reunion which some here may be attending as well When a deacon assists at Mass the deacon is often vested in a dalmatic which similar to the priests chasuble is a long tuniclike vestment As the deacon is configured to Christ the Servant they stand next to and assist the priest throughout most of the liturgy Their liturgical ministry is focused in a special way on the service of the Gospel and of the altar most especially to the Most Precious Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ This service to the Gospel is seen as the deacon carries in the Book of the Gospels in the entry procession and proclaims the Gospel at the proper time In addition he will also proclaim the general intercessions inviting us to prayer and to turn our needs to the Lord In service of the altar the deacon will assist in preparing the altar and at the end of the Eucharist Prayer elevate the chalice as the priest elevates the host Finally at the end of Mass the deacon assists the priest in sending the faithful outward into the world In addition to welcoming Dcn Bruce this weekend we will also have the opportunity to welcome Fr Bill Sullivan to our parish Fr Bill retired as the pastor of St John the Baptist in New Haven this past June before moving to Ossian As Ive previously mentioned a priest never truly retires Though he steps away from administrative work he continues to offer the Sacraments Fr Bill in his retirement has offered to assist in offering the Sacraments at parishes as needed When not assisting elsewhere Ive invited Fr Bill to join us as a concelebrant at our weekend liturgies Prior to his time in New Haven Fr Bill was my childhood pastor at St Thomas the Apostle in Elkhart This is a true joy unique to the diocesan priesthood That I as a priest am able to welcome my childhood pastor who helped me learn what it means to be a priest to our parish Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS
