21st the Church celebrates the Twenty fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our Gospel reading continues to follow after the Lord's death march towards Jerusalem Luke 9 19 As Jesus draws ever closer to Jerusalem He challenges His disciples us included this Sunday to choose in a clear and conscious way our goal in life God or money Turning to Amos for our first reading we are reminded of how wealth has been a seductive trap for the people of God throughout salvation history Believed to be the earliest of the literary prophets Amos a Judean prophesies to northern Israel around 760 BC The fourth of five visions this reading foresees great calamity falling upon Israel for their neglect of the poor and worship of false gods all for the pursuit of earthly profits Our Psalm in comparison reminds Israel of the utter poverty from which they came Known as one of the six Egyptian Praise psalms this psalm chanted during the Passover seder praises God for the exodus from Egypt It serves as a constant reminder to Israel that they were once slaves in a foreign land and were only brought out from that destitute poverty by the will of God All that they have truly comes from their utter dependence on God Brought full circle in our Gospel our Lord reminds us of what is important Not earthly riches but eternal salvation The Christian life does not seek out a Gospel based in worldly prosperity Instead it calls us to sacrifice material wealth for the gain of spiritual goods Jesus is not the means to an end He is the end Himself This life requires a constant spirit of conversion where we are always remembering whom we are serving and why we are doing so Parish Picnic Sunday Oct 5th after the 10 AM Mass Join us for our annual Parish Picnic on Sunday October 5th following the
