<p>Bishop Rhoades has asked all parishes in our diocese to resume public Masses the weekend of May 23rd/24th<span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;(the Feast of the Ascension of the Lord).</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>In addition to this request, the Bishop has also provided all parishes of the diocese with a thorough listing of prudential directives to be implemented in helping to ensure the physical safety, health, and well-being of all those who will be attending public Masses.</p>
<p>The obligation to attend Sunday Mass remains suspended for the foreseeable future, meaning those who are at high risk for infection of the Coronavirus or those who do not yet feel that it would be prudent for them to return to larger public gathering are invited and encouraged to remain at home.</p>
<p>To help facilitate those who cannot yet join us in person, St. Joseph's will continue to broadcast its liturgies on our parish website and through our social media.</p>
<p>As we begin to implement our return strategies for public Masses, we will provide additional information in the days and weeks to come, including information for our RCIA Candidates and our First Holy Communicants.</p>
