SIMILARITIES BETWEEN IER IORGIO AND ARLO CUTIS These two young saints are set to be canonized together but thats not all that they have in common with one another Devotion to Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati and Blessed Carlo Acutis is only growing as their canonization is quickly approaching on September 7 2025 These two young men are particularly appealing to the young faithful having led exemplary lives and acting as wonderful role models And when you look closer at their lives youll see that they have a lot in common We thought wed look at some of the similarities between these two Italian saintsinwaiting before they are raised to the heights of the altar 1 EEP AITH AND EVOTION Pier Giorgio Frassati Known for his deep love for the Eucharist and devotion to prayer Pier Giorgios faith was the cornerstone of his life He regularly attended Mass spent hours in adoration and had a profound devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary Carlo Acutis Carlo also had a remarkable devotion to the Eucharist often referring to it as his Highway to Heaven His deep faith was evident in his regular participation in Mass frequent confession and his efforts to promote Eucharistic miracles through his website 2 HARITY AND ERVICE TO THERS Pier Giorgio Frassati He was known for his extensive charitable work often helping the poor and sick in his community His life was marked by a genuine love for others seeing Christ in the faces of those he served He wouldnt hesitate to give the shoes he was wearing to someone in need Carlo Acutis Similarly Carlo was dedicated to helping others particularly through teaching his peers about the faith and volunteering at a soup kitchen He had a heart for the marginalized and used his technical skills to evangelize and educate He would save up money to buy tents for the homeless rather than buy things for himself 3 OY AND OLINESS IN VERYDAY IFE Pier Giorgio Frassati Despite his wealthy background Pier Giorgio lived a life of simplicity and joy His infectious joy and humor made him beloved by many In fact he was known for his pranks that were always funny and never meanspirited He found holiness in everyday activities including his love for mountain climbing Carlo Acutis Carlo was known for his joyful spirit and love for life which he balanced with his deep faith He enjoyed playing soccer video games and programming demonstrating that holiness is attainable in ordinary activities 4 AMILY IVES Pier Giorgio Frassati He was born into a welloff family with strong Catholic values Despite his parents initial misunderstanding of his deep faith they supported his education and charitable activities His deep love for his family meant that he always put them first to the extent that he hid the gravity of his illness Carlo Acutis Carlos family especially his mother played its own crucial role in nurturing his faith While she hadnt been going to Mass before his birth Acutis devotion encouraged her return to the Church Both his parents supported his interests and devotion which was instrumental in his spiritual development 5 ARLY EVOTION Pier Giorgio Frassati As a youth Pier Giorgio showed a strong inclination towards the Faith joining the Marian Sodality and the Apostleship of Prayer as a teenager Carlo Acutis Carlo exhibited an early devotion making daily visits to the Blessed Sacrament and praying the Rosary from a young age He also developed a keen interest in catechesis and Church history 6 CADEMIC AND XTRACURRICULAR I NTERESTS Pier Giorgio Frassati Although he found studying difficult he was a diligent student studying engineering at university When he finished studying he planned on using his education to serve those working in the coal mines His interests extended to mountain climbing and numerous other sports He was a keen linguist and could recite Dante Carlo Acutis Unlike Frassati Carlo was a brilliant student with a passion for computer science However he too used his talents for the good of others and created a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles combining his faith with his technical skills 7 INGUISTICALLY GIFTED Pier Giorgio Frassati One thing Pier Giorgio could do is communicate and in several languages As well as his Italian mothertongue he could speak German French and also Latin In a letter to his friend Carlo Bellingeri he also shared that he was trying to learn another classic stating Ill review my Greek about which I know nothing Carlo Acutis While the young techwhizz might not have had as many languages in his repertoire he was bilingual in English and Italian However ever humble Acutis would pretend in class that he didnt know the answer to questions to give others a chance 8 HOES Pier Giorgio Frassati The one thing Pier Giorgio loved was to help the less fortunate He would more than happily take the shoes off his feet to give to those in need much to his parents annoyance Carlo Acutis The young saint appeals to todays youth partly because of his shoes Seeing a saint in repose wearing a pair of Nikes makes him more relatable than the saints from decades and centuries before 9 IED YOUNG Pier Giorgio Frassati One of the saddest similarities between the two men is that they both died at an early age Frassati died at the age of 24 on July 4 99 years ago from polio His family was so focused on the declining health and eventual death of his grandmother just three days before his own passing that they hadnt realized just how sick he was There was a huge crowd at his funeral including those hed spent his life helping It was only then that people understood the extent of his service to others Carlo Acutis The young saint died of leukemia at the tender age of 15 Like Frassati he didnt make a fuss and offered up his suffering for the Pope and the Church His funeral too was full of people coming to pay their respects whose lives hed impacted httpsaleteiaorg20240704fascinatingsimilaritiesbetweenpiergiorgioandcarloacutis QLJKWVRIROXPEXV
