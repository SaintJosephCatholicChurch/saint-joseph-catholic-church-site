AND AVOID INFIDELITY IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD AND OUR NEIGHBOR AND TO HAVE THE DESIRE OF GOING HOME TO COME CLOSER TO GOD SO AS TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE THROUGH REPENTANCE My dear brothers and sisters in Christ the Lord be with you We thank God for our Parish Mission Week Everything went well The speakers did wonderful job It was really worth attending I want to thank the Parish Staff especially Sr Rose the Parish Council the Social Group and all those who helped in different capacities I want to say congratulation to those who attended the Mission Week Activities May God continue to help you as you struggle on the road to heaven For those families who have not taken and may want to take the Candle of the Mission Week 2018 and keep it in your home and light it whenever you pay let them do so after Mass Today is Laetare Sunday It is so called because we have successfully gone more than half way in Lent preparing for the glorious Easter Resurrection So we need to be happy And more importantly it has been the tradition of the catholic Church for centuries to call the 4th Sunday of Lent Laetare Sunday because the first word of the Entrance Antiphon hymn of today celebration is Rejoice Laetare In the 1st Reading just read Chr 361416 1923 the people of Israel were in captiv ity in Babylon the present Iraq They were alienated from their country because both the priests and the people added infidelity upon infidelity committing abominations and polluting the Temple and the land of the Lord Imagine now that there are some people in this US who are homeless living in tents at different cities These our brothers and sisters are right now living in miserable conditions They become refugees in their own country driven away from their homes because of natural disaster of various kinds As these our brothers and sisters are driven away by natural disasters and they are long ing to go back to their home so should some of us who are driven away from our spiri tual homes not by natural disasters but by our own sins should seek and desire to go back to their spiritual homes These set of people are anxious longing for their homes so should we As these people the homeless desire to go back home the Jews desired to go home We also should desire to go home spiritually by repentance recon ciliation and forgiveness through the sacrament of Penance or Confession In the Gospel Jn 31421 the Lord Jesus assured us of salvation if we can lift up our eyes to his cross As a bronze serpent was lifted in the desert which gave back life to those Jews who were bitten by the snake so shall we be saved if in faith we lift up our eyes to the cross of Christ So when it was the will of the Almighty God to deliver his people from the power of the king of Babylon he raised Cyrus a pagan king of Persia who gave a decree that all the people of the Lord should be allowed to return to their country and it was done Our brothers and sisters who were driven away from their home need our help There are 7 corporal works of mercy They are among the Lenten chal lenges I gave you to practice So some good works are needed from you But however it is important to say that good works should be seen as consequences of purification and signs of repentance And Confession is the outward sign of inward repentance The im portance of Confession cannot be overemphasized My dear brothers and sisters in Christ The Lenten Penance Service was conducted last week on March 7 2018 I hope you made use of it If you did not you have still opportunity on Good Friday after Sta tions of the Cross in the evening from 7:45pm to 8:15pm Come and confess your sins and dust off the dust of sin in your soul This is your last opportunity before Easter Make sure that you make use of it Come back home to God I hope you still remember the story of The Two Bottles BOTTLE and BOTTLE Which Bottle are you Make hast while the sun shines NB 1 The Former members of our Parish Pastoral Council
