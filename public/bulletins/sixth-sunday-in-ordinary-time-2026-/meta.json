Sunday in Ordinary Time February 15 2026 This weekend February 14th 15th the Church celebrates the Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time On Wednesday we move from Ordinary Time into the penitential season of Lent These coming forty days of prayer fasting and almsgiving will commence with the sprinkling of ashes on Ash Wednesday Having been instructed in the path of discipleship these past many weeks we now carry into Lent all that we have learned as we strive to grow in Christ Thank you to all those who volunteered at and participated in our Parish Listening Sessions for the Diocesan Synod Between two sessions we had 31 participants We will compile a report from what was shared touching upon the five areas of reflection Evangelization Catechesis Spiritual Liturgical Life Outreach and Vocations This report will be shared with Bishop Rhoades to aid in his preparation for the Diocesan Synod in November Ash Wednesday Wednesday February 18th As our forty days of prayer fasting and almsgiving begin this Wednesday we will offer three Mass times for Ash Wednesday February 18th at 7:00AM Noon and 7:00PM As is customary we will offer the imposition of ashes during each Mass Ashes have a long scriptural history as an outward sign of humility and penance This visible sign is meant to reflect our hearts as we begin forty days striving for a deeper conversion and growth in Christ Please remember Ash Wednesday February 18th is a day of abstinence and fasting On this day we abstain from meat as we also do every Friday throughout Lent and limit ourselves to one normal and two small meals throughout the day These biblical practices of fasting Matthew 914 15 and abstinence Daniel 102 3 strengthen our self discipline and remind us that our true end is not here on earth but in heaven Lenten Parish Devotions In addition to our personal Lenten observances that we discern to follow this year the parish is offering a number of additional opportunities for prayer throughout Lent This not only includes our regular weekday Mass Adoration and Confession schedules but also a number of special Lenten offerings added to the schedule Make sure to follow along with the Parish Calendar in the bulletin each weekend for a full schedule of these offerings Starting this Friday February 20th we will begin our weekly Soup Suppers at 5:30PM in the Parish Gym From 600 6:45PM we will offer a series on Prayer as a part of our Soup Suppers We will follow along with and discuss Dr Tim Gray's Prayer Finding Intimacy with God from the Augustine Institute Afterwards you are invited to join us in praying the Stations of the Cross at 7 PM in the Parish Social Hall Estate and Funeral Planning Presentation At the end this month we will be hosting a presentation on estate and funeral planning We will welcome an expert in estate planning to provide practical guidance on preparing your affairs and members of the Catholic Community Foundation of Northeast Indiana to discuss our St Joseph Endowment Fund and opportunities for planned giving Afterwards I will explain the Church's vision for Catholic funeral planning and why the funeral rites matter for our faith and our families Given the importance of this topic we are offering the same presentation twice to make it as available to you as possible The presentation will be offered in the Parish Gym on both Monday evening February 23th from 630 7:30PM and Thursday afternoon February 26th from 130 2:30PM We will have a variety of material available including information about St Joseph Catholic Cemetery our parish
