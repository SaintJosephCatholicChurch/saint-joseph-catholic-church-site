  "text": "Thirty Third Sunday in Ordinary Time November 13 2022 This weekend November 12th 13th the Church celebrates the Thirty third Sunday in Ordinary Time Earlier this week our country and communities voted for the elected representatives of many local and national offices Listening to the words of St Paul 1 Timothy 21 4 all of us should pray fervently for our newly elected officials that they might pursue the common good and respect the dignity of all human persons It is good to see many of our parishioners taking an active part in the life of our community This active life doesn't end with elections though There are many other ways to continue serving our broader community and doing so gives witness to our Faith In this service we show how we are called as Christians to build a society that more closely resembles the Kingdom of God It is this very concept that we will celebrate next week with the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe Advent Wreath Making As we are nearing the season of Advent you are invited to our annual Advent Wreath Making event this Thursday November 17th at 6:30PM in the Parish Social Hall This event allows each parishioner to make an Advent wreath for their own home and to use it as a center for prayer in the home throughout Advent Please see the sign up sheet in the Narthex or contact the Parish Office The Bells of St Joseph Carillon Update After working with Chime Master and consulting both our Parish and Finance Councils it was decided that we are best served upgrading our current malfunctioning carillon bell system for a new model The new carillon system has been ordered and is scheduled to be installed prior to Thanksgiving Thank you again for your generosity and faithful support to our monthly Rainy Day Fund which made this needed and unexpected change possible Home Blessings Tribunal Work and Thesis Writing Thank you for your continued patience regarding the scheduling of requested home blessings Between parish ministry and tribunal work I am still trying to find an appropriate way to balance my calendar I have continued to dedicate two afternoons a week to working in our Tribunal and the occasional free evening if needed as an advocate In addition to this work I have also had the opportunity to experience the administrative side of the Tribunal during these afternoons Assisting our Judicial Vicar Fr Jake Runyon I've been readily reminded of the universal or Catholic nature of the Church Over the past two months I've been tasked with everything from translating various documents that we have received from the Vatican as Latin is still the official language of the Church to contacting the Apostolic Signatura of the Roman Rota which is the Supreme Court of the Church If you wish to contact the Roman Rota you will need to find a fax machine and hope the line isn't busy Hint It's almost always busy In addition to parish ministry and tribunal work I've also continued work on my licentiate thesis At the moment I am still in the research phase finding and reading a variety of sources relating to parish boundaries and registration within Church law I was excited to hear just a few weeks ago that my Tribunal counterpart currently studying in Rome has chosen to pursue this same topic as a part of her doctoral dissertation I do think the canonical literature will begin to see much writing on our country's novel view of parish registration in the coming years It is quite an exciting topic Note For your planning purposes a special Mass on Thanksgiving Day Thursday Nov 24th will be offered at 9:00AM Mass on Friday Nov 25th will be at 7:00PM as I will be traveling to visit family over the holiday MASS INTENTIONS Saturday November 12 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm
