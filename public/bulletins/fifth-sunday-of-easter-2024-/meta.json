Fifth Sunday of Easter April 28 2024 This weekend April 27th 28th the Church celebrates the Fifth Sunday of Easter Narratively this Sunday marks a shift in our Eastertide readings Our previous weekends focused on the concrete events surrounding Jesus appearances following His resurrection From today onward our readings focus on Jesus teaching about His impending ascension and the gift of the Holy Spirit to be sent onto the Apostles as Pentecost Narratively our Gospel parable of the vine and the branches comes from the fifteenth chapter of St John's Gospel This is in the midge of the Last Supper Discourse and concludes with the Lord being taken away for trial In this way he is preparing the Apostles for His departure Though this parable is not speaking specifically to the Ascension the message remains the same Our unity is found in the Lord who is the true vine This becomes a fitting Gospel theme in preparation for the Ascension and Pentecost Remaining United in Christ In the words of Pope Benedict XVI the fundamental background for the Parable of the Vine is Baptism we are implanted in Christ and the Eucharist we are one loaf one body one blood one life with Christ In Baptism and in the Eucharist we remain united and nourished as members of the one body that is the Body of Christ the Church Our bulletin cover this weekend is a painting entitled Christ the True Vine from the Basilica of St Castor in Karden Germany The artist equates the vine with the tree of the cross the Apostles with the branches sprouting from the cross God the Father at the foot of the cross tree tending to its roots the Blessed Virgin on the other side watering the sacred tree Beneath the tree is an assortment of great saints aspiring to the sanctity to which we are called Rosary Path and Springtime As the Spring weather continues to settle in we find ourselves spending more time outside As a reminder our Rosary Path is a wonderful place to spend time in prayer and contemplation in the midst of the beauty of creation We also have the parish playground right near the Rosary Path with several benches and a picnic table available for use Never hesitate to stop over and spend some time at our beautiful campus throughout the week If you are interested in helping to upkeep the Rosary Path throughout this Spring and Summer please contact the Parish Office <a href=\"tel:(260)824-1380\">(260)824-1380</a> As you might expect the path can use some weeding and general gardening throughout the growing seasons Our general grounds crew offers basic upkeep to the Rosary Path as they maintain the full campus but it's always open for extra care from those at the parish who enjoy gardening or yardwork St Joseph the Worker Feast Day Wednesday May 1st On Wednesday May 1st the Church celebrates the Memorial of St Joseph the Worker This is one of two feast days throughout the Church year that specifically celebrates our parish patron St Joseph The other feast day is the Solemnity of St Joseph Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary on March 19th This feast day is itself a more modern addition to our liturgical calendar added by Pope Pius XII in 1955 Pius XII's action followed in the footsteps of his predecessor Pope Pius XI who called upon St Joseph to protect the whole Church from the errors of communion in 1937 Because of this St Joseph was often invoked in support of the cause of workers rights This culminated with Pius XII's institution of this feast day as an acknowledgement of the humble workman of Nazareth who showed forth the dignity of the man who works with his hands The choice of May 1st as the day of this feast day is itself also tied to the dignity of human work While May 1st or May Day was not originally a religious or political holiday it was designed as Communist Worker's Day in the mid 20th Century in a number of countries In response to this Pius XII invoked St Joseph the Worker as a way of denouncing the falsehoods of communism while elevating the dignity of workers in a very specific way PARISH CALENDAR Sat April 27 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sun April 28 Mass 7:30am Mass 10:00am Sun April 28 Religious
