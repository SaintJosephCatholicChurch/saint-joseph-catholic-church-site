special Thank you to Michelle Paxton our Director of Religious Edu cation and all of our Catechists for the Religious Education Signup and Kickoff celebration last Saturday Our Religious Ed Classes K8th Grade and Youth Group 9th12th Grade begin next weekend Sept 8th Classes occur between our two Sunday Masses from 8:30am 9:45am If you havent yet had a chance to register your children for religious ed or youth group please call Michelle in the Parish Of fice 8241380 to register It is a true privilege for our religious ed program to aid each family in the religious education of our children Our weekly lessons are meant to serve as supple mentary lessons for the Faith that is being passed on at home Part of this passing on of the Faith is found in daily prayer together as a family As the motto of the popular 1940s radio series Family Rosary Crusade stated The family that prays together stays to gether I strongly encourage each family in our parish to spend a few moments to gether in prayer each and every day It is in prayer that we encounter the voice of God in our lives This can in clude the reading of a Scripture passage each day praying a family rosary praying together before meals attending weekday Mass or adoration as a family etc Reli gious education is not simply gaining an intellectual knowledge of the Faith but en tering into a personal relationship with our Lord As with any relationship our rela tionship with God requires conversation which is found first in prayer Homebound Hospital Ministries and Anointing of the Sick If you or a loved one are admitted to the hospital or an extended care facility and would like to be visited by a priest please contact the Parish Office 8241380 Due to privacy laws such as HIPAA hospitals and other facilities are not able to inform parishes when parishioners are admitted into their care or move facilities If we know when you or a loved one are in the hospital or an extended care facility I would be happy to come and visit If you or a loved one will be in recovery for an extended period and unable to join us for the Sacrifice of the Mass on weekends you can also be added to our weekly communion call list Our Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion to the Sick and Homebound do tremendous work to ensure that those who cannot physi cally join us for Mass are still able to receive our Lord in the Holy Eucharist This practice of bringing our Lord in the Holy Eucharist to those ill or imprisoned dates back to the very beginnings of the Church Or if you might feel yourself called to assist in our outreach to the sick and homebound please contact the Parish Office to learn more about this ministry Lastly if you or a loved one will be undergoing major surgery or are severely ill and would like to receive the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick James 51415 please contact the Parish Office or if it is a confidential matter speak to me directly either after Mass or by email This Sacrament not only strengthens those of us who are ill and unites us to our Lords passion but can even bring about physical healing if it would aid in the salvation of our souls If you ever have any questions regard ing this Sacrament or when it can be received feel free to ask I am happy to help answer your questions and ensure that the Sacraments are always readily available Faithfully in Christ Fr David Note I will be away from the parish for part of the week Due to my summer classes I have not had the chance to take any vacation since this past February After Masses on Sunday I will be driving to
