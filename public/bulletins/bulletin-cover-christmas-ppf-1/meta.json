  "text": "ERRY HRISTMAS Merry Christmas As we enter this Christmas season may the peace and joy of Jesus Christ be with you and your families and remain with you forever This Christmas will for most of us be quite different than previous years Yet the reason we celebrate remains the same For today in the city of David a savior has been born for you who is Christ and Lord Luke 211 During these times my mind keeps wandering back to the words of Pope Francis Urbi et Orbi in March Given all that has occurred in the world that this is truly a time to choose what matters and what passes away a time to separate what is necessary from what is not It is a time to get our lives back on track with regard to you Lord and to others What a beautiful sentiment to take into this Christmas season As we celebrate the Incarnation of Jesus Christ may we seek out what is truly important in this life Through the love of family and friends may we come to encounter the love of God May we know His peace and joy at every moment and may it lead us joyously into this New Year Faithfully in Christ Fr David As is our parish tradition St Josephs offers a gift to every parish family and all those joining us this weekend as a part of our Christmas and Easter celebrations This Christmas thanks to the assistance of the St Joseph Womens Group we are able to gift the entire parish two books I Heard God Laugh Practical Guide to Lifes Essential Daily Habit and Do Something Beautiful for God The Essential Teachings of Mother Teresa I Heard God Laugh is the newest book from Dynamic Catholics Matthew Kelly In this quick read Kelly offers a variety of insights into the necessity of the spiritual life and challenges the reader to ensure that they are nurturing and feeding their soul Do Something Beautiful for God offers a brief biography of St Mother Teresa of Calcutta The remainder of the book offers a different quote from Mother Teresa for each day of the calendar year to be used in prayerful meditation These quotes can be used as the spiritual nourishment that Matthew Kelly speaks of in I Heard God Laugh We hope you find these books useful and the insights they offer to be spiritual nourishing as we celebrate the Incarnation of Jesus Christ and prepare to enter into a New Year Thank you for your kindness Thank You to everyone who sent a Christmas card made homemade cookies and candy gave gift cards and Christmas gifts May you receive Gods abundant blessings and the desires of your heart in the coming new year Merry Christmas Michelle OUR BULLETIN COVER very special THANK

Gloria in excelsis Deo Gloria in excelsis Deo Come to Bethlehem and see Him whose birth the angels sing Come adore on bended knee Christ the Lord the newborn King Gloria in excelsis Deo Gloria in excelsis Deo Christmas means so many things to me One thing that means a lot is spending time with my family We put up the tree and ornaments make cookies and on Christmas Eve we always drive around and look at the lights after Church I love seeing my familys faces when they open up the gifts I give to them But the thing that means the most to me is that it is Jesus birthday Anna Hartman Grade 4 What Christmas means to me is getting ready to take a nap on Christmas Eve so when its time for the Christmas Vigil Mass Im not tired Its the frantically trying to get grades up before the end of the semester Its the Church getting all decorated and giving off the warm Its seeing friends and family that you dont always get to see Brendan McCorkle Grade 12 What Christmas Means to Me By Josephine Andrews Grade 6 There are a lot of things that make Christmas well Christmas Of course theres the presents Santa Claus and the smells of dinner wafting from the kitchen decorating the tree the smell of the crisp cool air But what it really means to me is being to gether as a family It also means caring and giving to those who cant care for them selves Its the day Jesus was born in that little stable in Bethlehem The way he sac rificed himself for us inspires me to sacrifice what I can for others especially during the Christmas season So what Christmas means to me is caring loving family and friends caroling cooking and going to Mass on Christmas Eve together as a family to go celebrate Jesus birth Thats what Christmas means to me I like Christmas It is Jesus birthday We get to see our family I get to play with my cousin Grandma makes cookies We go to Mass on Christmas Eve I stay up really late Santa comes and we got a Lego train Mom and I shop for presents for the tree at Church I really like Christmas Lucas Streeter Grade 2 What Christmas means to me is a day to celebrate the day Jesus was born I like to celebrate Christmas by spreading joy Olivia Hoffacker Grade 2 There are so many things I think about when it comes to Christmas The first thing I think about is Jesus birth While my family and I are in the car on our way to my grandmas house We sing happy birthday to him Second being with my family I love being with my family On Christmas Eve my little brother usually sleeps in my sister or my room Last I think about the faces I will see when people open the gifts I have got for them Every December my family except my mom all go shopping together to look for present for her Christmas is my favorite holiday and time of year because all the special meaning it has Addison Roembke Grade 7 There is no doubt Christmas is a wonderful time of year Its a time to share joy and gifts with family and friends Christmas is a unique and festive season which brings us closer to each other through parties celebrations and fun traditions For most of us Christmas this year in the midst of the pan demic is going to look a little different than normal With social distancing and recommended re strictions on group gatherings Christmas may be a little less exciting a little quieter and a little lone lier than usual Some may see this as a dreadful way to spend the Christmas time but I will embrace it Embrace the isolation and use it as a time to reflect and be reverent during the Advent season The pandemic gives you the perfect opportunity to be around your immediate family members and to sim ply slow down on a season which would typically be hectic Use this time of being alone to be in the silence and darkness to remember God came into the world to be like you so you could be more like him Remember he lives in you always and calls out to you in the silence Christmas means to me a time of spreading joy and having fun but most important for me its a time to reflect and grow closer to God Christmas this year may not be the one youre fa miliar to or even the Christmas you want but it may be the most important Justin Mayer Grade 12 Joan
