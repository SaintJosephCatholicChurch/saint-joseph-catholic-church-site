822 31 Ps 84 9 Rom 51 5 Jn 1612 15 Pentecost Sunday June 8 2025 This weekend June 7th 8th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Pentecost marking the fiftieth and final day of the Easter season before we return to Ordinary Time While the Easter season draws to a close the joy of Eastertide continues This enduring joy is reflected in the upcoming solemnities that follow Pentecost Trinity Sunday and Corpus Christi Reflecting on these mysteries we are drawn deeper into the heart of our Faith The coming season of Ordinary Time invites us into a deeper reflection on the life of the Church and the journey of the Christian soul Having celebrated the mysteries of Christs life over the past several months we now live in the light of the Resurrection This coming season of Ordinary Time offers us the opportunity to consider how His life into which we are united through the Church is meant to transform our own Parish Renovation Updates Last Wednesday I had the opportunity to meet with our Diocesan Finance Council This was the last of several diocesan committees that we needed approval from to move forward with our proposed parish renovations After a short presentation we have received approval to move forward to the bidding phase This approval allows us to begin conversations with local contractors and to begin to bid out the work for our renovation Once having received this approval I contacted three local construction companies Schenkel Construction Shawnee Construction and Weigand Construction These three Fort Wayne based companies have served as general contractors for other Catholic Churches throughout our diocese and all come highly recommended Working through this phase we will receive bids and see about bringing one of these three onboard as our general contractor Once these three bids are received we will submit them to our Diocesan Finance Council for further review The council not only ensures the financial viability of projects throughout the diocese but also provides guidance and oversight when choosing contractors for large projects Once we receive approval to move forward with a specific contractor we will then be able to set the timeline for our renovations Mark Your Calendars Corpus Christi Procession On Sunday June 22nd the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Corpus Christi Following our 10 AM Mass on Sunday June 22nd we will hold our annual Corpus Christi Procession In a Eucharistic Procession we follow after the Lord physically even as we pledge anew to do so spiritually We also give public witness to our acceptance of the Lord's words The bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world John 651 Camp Damascus Fundraiser Fourteen of our parish youth will be attending the Catholic Youth Summer Camp
