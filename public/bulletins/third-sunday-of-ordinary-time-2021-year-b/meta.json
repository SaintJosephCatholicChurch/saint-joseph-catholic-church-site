  "text": "HIRD UNDAY IN RDINARY IME ANUARY 24 2021 This weekend January 23rd 24th the Church enters into and celebrates the Third Sunday of Ordinary Time In his 2019 apostolic letter Aperuit illis Pope Francis dedicated this liturgical weekend to the celebration study and sharing of the Word of God Though our liturgies are so imbued with the Sacred Scriptures we often do not realize this Outside of the Liturgy of the Word itself much of the dialogue exchanged and prayers offered throughout the Mass are rooted in the Sacred Scriptures This however cannot be the limit of our scriptural study and reflection This weekend as described by Pope Francis serves as a chance to truly appreciate the inexhaustible riches contained in the constant dialogue between the Lord and His people Reading and meditating upon the Sacred Scriptures should be a daily part of our lives both in our personal meditation and as a family It allows us to not only grow in knowledge of Jesus Christ but to deepen our personal relationship with Him May we keep in mind the cautious words of St Jerome Ignorance of Scripture is ignorance of Christ PDATES TO OUR ITURGICAL IRECTIVES Last week we received revised directives from the diocese which updated a variety of practices that we have been following at all public liturgies during the ongoing pandemic Among other practices the diocese has approved that soft congregational singing may resume in parishes at the discretion of the pastor as long as the faithful are wearing masks Less boisterous singing should be planned for the congregation This decision was reached by our diocesan Office of Worship and approved by Bishop Rhoades after consultation with a variety of infectious disease experts Those consulted advised that the risk posed by a more quiet style of singing is minimal IF we universally adhere to the existing mask and distancing requirements This update applies to congregational singing but not to cantors and choirs As cantors and choirs engage in more vigorous and forceful singing the general guidelines already in place for these two ministries continue to remain the same Given the precautions that we do have in place including our constructed cantor box we are able to ensure that our cantors can safely sing from an enclosed space in the choir loft as suggested in the diocesan directives For the foreseeable future we will be moving slowly to ensure that we are properly prepared when prudently reintroducing these practices In the coming weeks we will begin inviting volunteer cantors to offer their gift of song in the form of prelude music as the Responsorial Psalm andor as a Communion meditation When sung these parts will be only sung by the cantor for the time being We will continue to recite the Mass Parts the Alleluia the Gloria the Sanctus etc so that they might be recited together by all as recommended by our Office of Worship This coming week we are opening the formal search process for our new Director of Sacred Music and Liturgy Please keep this search process in your prayers Once this position has been filled it is my belief that we will then be in a place to determine how to best move towards the safe resumption of congregational singing Watch the bulletin for further updates MASS INTENTIONS Saturday January 23 8:00am Special Intention 4:00pm Confessions 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm
