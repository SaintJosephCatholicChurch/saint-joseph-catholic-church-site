Church celebrates the Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time Traditionally this started the Gesima Sundays or the three Sundays before Lent The word gesima is a Latin affix that helped create the words for seventy sixty and fifty This Sunday was known as Septuagesima Sunday marking the seventy days from this day until the end of the Easter Octave on Divine Mercy Sunday As we moved towards the forty days of Lent these three Sundays were meant to count us down seventy sixty and fifty until we reached the beginning of the Lenten season on Ash Wednesday These three Gesima Sundays then were seen as a period of preparation for Lent That the Church felt that the coming season of Lent needed a period of preparation should help give us better understanding of how we are called to approach Lent itself Differing from Gesima Sundays Lent is not merely a time of preparation for Easter Instead Lent is meant to bring about a true change in us so that we might better reflect the joy of the Resurrection through our lives When writing to the church in Corinth St Paul compares the Christian life with an athletic contest 1 Cor 924 25 Lent serves as a major part of this contest as it is a time when we devote ourselves in a special way to the spiritual life Throughout Lent we are meant to face our sins and fight against our daily temptations Through the Lenten disciplines of prayer fasting and almsgiving we wrestle with ourselves and grow in discipline In the words of St Paul we discipline our bodies as we run so as to win that imperishable crown And like any athlete we cannot simply enter into this contest without proper preparation This is where the Gesima Sundays are important We are not simply ticking off the days until Lent over these next few weekends Instead we are prayerfully discerning and preparing for the coming season of Lent Prior to a contest an athlete prepares by planning and training They do this because they want to win We are meant to do the same As we prepare for Lent may we begin discerning now what sins we struggle with and how may we work to overcome them in these coming forty days Living with the Saints St Bernadette of Soubirous Our Saint Profile this weekend focuses on St Bernadette of Soubirous St Bernadette is most well known as the young child to whom Our Lady appeared to in Lourdes France from February 11 to July 16 1858 During these apparitions Our Lady when asked her name stated that she was the Immaculate Conception This was seen as an affirmation of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception which had only been defined four years prior Throughout the eighteen visions that St Bernadette experienced Our Lady reaffirmed the Gospel call to prayer penance and poverty Likewise she offered a simple and joyful reminder God loves us Since then Lourdes has become one of the most popular pilgrimage sites throughout the world Even today countless numbers claim miraculous healings at Lourdes attested to by crutches left behind by pilgrims as a sign of physical healing St Bernadette was only fourteen years old when these apparitions occurred Shortly after she pursued religious life eventually taking the habit and joining the Sisters of Charity in the distant city of Nevers She would spend the rest of her life at the motherhouse working while she was able in their infirmary Eventually she herself contracted tuberculosis and due to her chronic ill health entered into eternal life on April 16 1879 at the age of thirty five Until the latest revision of the liturgical calendar St Bernadette's feast day was celebrated on February 18th Though a saint's feast day is often associated with the day of their earthly death St Bernadette's was initially in February to mark the third vision of Our Lady On February 18 1858 Our Lady told St Bernadette I do not promise to make you happy in this world but in the other How fitting then to recognize St Bernadette as a Saint on this day as we celebrate the fulfillment of Our Lady's promise to her Faithfully in Christ Fr David Weekend of February 22nd 23rd 500 Dan Lautzenheiser 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Jay Crisp 500 Ginny Fenstermaker 730 Carol Butler 1000 Patti Clark

priests from the 1860s onward the five original Catholic families in Wells County petitioned Bishop Joseph Dwenger the second bishop of the Diocese of Fort Wayne to establish a mission parish in Bluffton The bishop agreed and established this new parish in 1875 under the patronage of St Joseph Construction on the new parish church began almost immediately Land was donated by the Zimmerman family on the corner of Williams and Cherry Streets The building project cost 1300 equivalent to 38000 today and measured 30 by 50 feet Upon completion the Church was dedicated by Bishop Dwenger that
