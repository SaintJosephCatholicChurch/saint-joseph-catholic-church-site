Sun Oct 28 Thirtieth Sunday in Ordinary Time Jer 3179 Heb 516 Mk 104652 29th Sunday in Ordinary Time October 21 2018 Year Over the past several weeks our readings especially our Gospels have challenged each of us to grow in our personal relationship with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ To be a Christian is not simply a philosophy but an entire way of life As disciples of our Lord we are called to follow after Him even to the Cross Yet though the Apostles in our Gospel today struggle to understand we know that the Cross though necessary is not the end We follow our Lord to the Cross so that we might follow Him to what lies beyond The Heavenly Kingdom It is here that our grief will become joy and our hearts will rejoice John 1620 22 May the authentic joy of Jesus Christ always remain alive in our hearts and guide our witness to the Gospel message This joy that must permeate our lives in every way is even seen in our Churchs liturgical calendar The Church calendar is broken into six different seasons Advent Christmas Lent the Triduum Easter and Ordinary Time Each season serves a different purpose such as a time of preparation Advent Lent and the Triduum a time of celebration Christmas and Easter or a time of conversion Ordinary Time Each of these seasons focused on the different parts of Jesus life serve to renew our joy as each year it reminds us to unite our lives to His life Throughout the year we also celebrate the lives of those who have imitated Christ and help point us to Him when we commemorate the lives of the Saints through Holy Days and Feast Days On November 1 we will celebrate the Solemnity of All Saints We rejoice on this Holy Day with our brothers and sisters who having kept the faith 2 Timothy 468 are now united with Christ in the Communion of Saints The life of every Saint is one that imitates the life of our Saviour and in celebrating their lives we celebrate the life of Him whom they have lived for Jesus Christ This celebration takes place first and foremost in our Eucharist celebration At Mass we the Church Militant we here on earth are joined not only to the Choirs of Angels but also to the Church Tri umphant the Saints in Heaven and the Church Suffering those being purified in Pur gatory 1 Peter 17 As the entirety of the Church the mystical Body of Christ is united in one chorus praising God we glimpse Heaven on earth as we celebrate and pray the Mass This heavenly celebration serves to renew our joy as God comes to us and makes Himself present to us in a unique way through the Eucharist And just as we gather to worship together as one family we also called to celebrate together Such days as All Saints Day are not called Feast Days for no reason They are days to be joyfully celebrated in both worship and fraternity Following our 5:30PM Evening Holy Day Mass on Nov 1 all are invited to the social hall for our first Annual All Saints Day Party and Potluck There will be games for children and adults and our children are invited to dress up as their favorite Saint In the Saints we see that which we ourselves long for Union with God in the Heavenly Kingdom As we hope to one day be numbered among this same communion this Holy Day is truly a day worth celebrating together as a parish family I hope to see you there St Michael the Archangel in Sacred Tradition Devotion to St Michael the Archangel is often traced to at least the early 4th Century At that time it is believed that the Emperor Constantine dedicated a church to the patronage of St Michael north of modernIstanbul indicating local devotion to the archangel in the surrounding area Devotion to this leader of Gods army appears to have become widespread in the universal Church by the early6 th Century attested to by the various churches dedicated to his patronage and mention of him in the writings of various Church Fathers Given the scriptural references of St Michael as a warrior he is often consider a patron saint to members of the various branches of the military and police officers The practice of reciting the Prayer to St Michael the Archangel after Mass which we will pray together starting Nov 1 has more recent origins Though the ori gins of the prayer itself are not known it is possible that it was composed by Pope Leo XIII in 1884 At this point in history the Papal States had been occupied and annexed by the Kingdom of Italy The Vatican would remain a contested territory until the sov ereign Vatican citystate was recognized in 1929 At this time it is also suggested the Leo had a mystical experience where he recognized the turbulent political atmosphere as being a symptom of a greater spiritual battle This led to him asking that certain prayers including the Prayer to St Michael the Archangel be prayed by the Faithful at the conclusion of every Mass throughout the world These prayers became known as the Leonine Prayers and were prayed at the end of Mass up through the Second Vatican Council In Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF October 2728 2018 CANTORS 500 Sr Rose Ehrlich 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Jay Crisp LECTORS 500 Glenn Ryan 730 Geoff Frank 1000 Ed Shestak EUCHARISTIC
