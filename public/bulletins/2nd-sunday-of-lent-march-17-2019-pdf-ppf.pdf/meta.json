Tabor with our Lord and see Him transfigured in glory before continuing on the way to Jerusalem This moment serves as a reminder We experience Mount Tabor to prepare us for Mount Calvary These Forty Days of Lent lead us to the Cross so that we might also be led to the glory of the Resurrection Upcoming Parish Events This Tuesday March 19 the Church celebrates the Solemnity of St Joseph Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary St Joseph entrusted as the fosterfather of our Lord is recognized as a special patron for all fa thers and for the universal Church which is the Body of Christ As he is also our parish namesake every solemnity honoring St Joseph serves as a special patronal feast day for our parish and is a day worthy of celebrating To celebrate St Josephs Day we will offer a special eve ning Mass this Tuesday March 19 at 7pm followed by a Sundae Bar in the Parish Social Hall after Mass As St Josephs Day is a solemnity a celebration of the greatest importance we are welcome to relax our Lenten observances on this day We see this practice of celebration reflected even in our liturgy as this is one of only two days during the Lenten Season at which we will recite the Gloria together at Mass the other being the Annunciation of the Lord on March 25 Outside of these two days the Gloria a hymn of praise will not rise again from our lips during this penitential season un til we rejoice together at the Easter Vigil Following St Josephs Day we once again wholeheartedly resume our Lenten practices of prayer fast ing and almsgiving as we continue in these forty days of penance Over the past several weeks I have received many questions pertaining to the Churchs teachings on end of life care and her guid ance regarding funeral arrangements Given this expressed interest we will dedicate our discussion forum to these topics in April Due to the timing of Holy Week we will offer the discussion forum on both Sunday April 7 between the morning Masses 8:30am and Wednesday April 10 after the 7pm evening Mass 7:30pm in the Parish Social Hall At our 7:30am Sunday Mass this weekend we are presenting our Elect Brady and Candidates for Full Communion Diane and Diane with the Creed Having spent this past year in prayer study and dis cernment we join with them this Lenten Season as a parish family as they prepare to be received into the Church at the Easter Vigil As a part of this preparation we now entrust to them this ancient text that they have become familiar with and which expresses the heart of the Churchs faith and prayer in Jesus Christ Just as we present it to them this weekend may we always be able to show a lived example of our faith through our daily lives Over the next three Sundays we will also join in prayer with Brady Diane and Diane in a special way through the celebration of the Scrutinies In the Three Scrutinies we hear of the interior call to conver sion that is made to each of us and in that call we are implored to turn to the Lord for strength and healing As these three continue their preparation for the Easter Vigil may we keep them in the forefront of our prayers We look forward with great joy to welcome them fully into union with the Church at the end of these forty days and the Sacred Paschal Triduum as we celebrate together the Lords resurrection Faithfully in Christ Fr David ST ALOYSIUS FISH FRY St Aloysius
