chael Green and Dorothy Dottie Marbach 15Th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME JULY 16 2017 YR From the Pastors Desk WE ARE CHALLENGED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE WORD OF GOD My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all word spoken or written always has something to do with the person who speaks or writes There is power and inspiration in human word how much more in the word of God The power of Gods word is like germinal force of the seed which pieces the soil its tenderness notwithstanding In the 1st Reading Is 551011 Prophet Isaiah introduces the team of todays Gos pel The Prophet says that as the rain and snow come down and do not return there till they have watered the earth making it fertile so shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth my word shall not return to me void but shall do my will achieving the end for which I sent it Are we disposed to the word of God Various kinds of peo ple hear the word of God but the results are not the same in all people Why It is be cause the disposition in people differs Where do you classify yourself If you spread oil on a surface of any piece of land water cannot permeate or saturate the land or the soil If the land fails to suck and absorb the water it is not the fault of water but of the problem of the soil So we must do everything possible to be good soil good people for the word of God to bear good fruits in us That Is why St Paul in the 2nd Reading Rom 81823 Ad monished us thus that the sufferings of this present time are as nothing compared with the glory to be revealed for us Therefore we must do everything possible to in herit the Kingdom life everlasting in heaven Then in the Gospel Mt 13123 or 19 The Lord Jesus used the parable of the sower to show us how different people respond to the word of God the word of eternal life There are 4 categories of seeds and soil Likewise there are 4 categories of people To which group do you belong It is always your choice If you are the seed on what type of soil will you like to fall If you are the soil what kind of soil do you like to be Surely every one of us will like to fall on the good soil if you are the seed Not on the path way or stony ground or on rocky soil If you are the soil you will love to be the good soil and not any of the other bad soil The ball is now on our court Strive strug gle do your best to be saved The best gift you can give to someone is the gift of salva tion So Heaven is for us all what really are you doing about it God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it NB 1 We are organizing Marriage Encounter Parish Based Please register quickly 2 We are also planning a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land next year It will be after Easter
