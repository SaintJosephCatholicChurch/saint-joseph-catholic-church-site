  "text": "Twenty Second Sunday in Ordinary Time August 28 2022 This weekend August 27th 28th the Church celebrates the Twenty second Sunday in Ordinary Time With three months remaining in Ordinary Time our readings continue to serve as a reflection for the Christian soul Through this yearly cycle we are constantly being reminded of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ This weekend especially we are reminded in readings of the virtue of humility In humility we recognize our true worth before God by recognizing our need for God in our lives Catholicism Explained The RCIA Program Starting on Thursday September 8th we are holding our Introductory Session for the Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults RCIA at 6:30PM in the Parish Social Hall This year we ve renamed our weekly gathering as Catholicism Explained This new name emphasizes that the program is open to all Each year the sessions are often attended by those desiring to enter the Church those who are Catholic and seeking a refresher course and those who are non Catholic and simply want to learn more about the Catholic Faith Following the opening session on September 8th Catholicism Explained will begin to meet weekly on Thursdays at 6:30PM in the Parish Social Hall If you know of anyone who might be interested in this program please invite them to attend For those who are non Catholic and are interested in entering the Church please let me know if this weekly time will not work for your schedule We can work together to find a time that will work for you Working within our Tribunal In addition to working on my thesis this year I have also been asked to begin work in our diocesan Tribunal Initially scheduled to begin the first week of September I actually began weekly meetings with my counterpart in our Tribunal shortly after returning from Washington DC As my counterpart will be traveling to Rome for doctorate studies I will be taking on their workload until their return to the Tribunal next summer This means that throughout this year I will be serving as an advocate within our Tribunal An advocate serves as a representative for those who are going through the marriage nullity process also referred to as the annulment process To better facilitate this ministry and the workload it involves I will be keeping afternoon office hours at our Tribunal in Fort Wayne one day a week generally on Tuesdays Thankfully this will not affect our parish schedule in any significant way Did You Know Altars At the center of nearly every Catholic church is an altar on which the Mass is offered Often one or more relics of martyrs are commonly set into the altar into or in an altar stone within the altar The use of relics highlight how in the early Church the altar was often the tomb of a martyr Due to the persecutions of the time the Church would often be forced to secretly gather together in the catacombs to safely offer the Mass The altar itself has many meanings According to the Rite for the Dedication of a Church the altar stands as a sign of Christ Himself who is the priest the victim and the altar of His own sacrifice The altar can also be seen to symbolize the table of the Last Supper the altar of the Temple in Jerusalem the cross of Calvary the tomb of Christ s burial and resurrection and the altar in heaven Simply put the altar symbolizes Christ himself in the many facets of His existence as fulfillment of the Old Testament typologies as God present with His people on earth and the prefigurement of the eternal glorious banquet of heaven which is wholly communion and feast As with all things in the church building itself the altar serves to help us encounter Jesus Christ As the altar stands in the midst of the Sanctuary so Christ is in the midst of His people As the altar remains fixed and present to us so Christ always remains present in our lives Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday August 27 8:00am Special Intention 400
