  "text": "HE OLY AMILY OF JESUS ARY AND JOSEPH ECEMBER 27 2020 This Friday Jan 1st the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Mary Mother of God which marks the end of the Christmas Octave but not the Christmas season While this celebration is a yearly Holy Day the obligation to attend the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass on this day remains dispensed by Bishop Rhoades due to COVID19 Though not a Holy Day of Obligation this year may we see it as a holy day of opportunity For those able to join us in person Masses will be offered on Thursday Dec 31st at 5 PM and Friday Jan 1st at 7:30AM and 10 AM The 10 AM Mass will be livestreamed This solemnity finds its roots from the Council of Ephesus in the 5th Century This Church council declared the Blessed Virgin Mary as Theotokos or Godbearer As we celebrate this solemnity we offer due veneration or respect to the Blessed Virgin Mary while also asserting the divinity of her Son Jesus Christ We welcome Fr Nathan Maskal as our celebrant for the Solemnity Masses Fr Maskal is assisting us while he is in the area to visit family Likewise I will be in South Bend to assist at his parish while also visiting with my family Though the end of the Christmas Octave does not end the Christmas season it is still a quick season this year given how late in the week Christmas Day fell Next weekend we celebrate the Epiphany of the Lord and the following weekend the Baptism of the Lord This latter feast will end the Christmas season and move us towards Ordinary Time though the Christmas season will have a brief resurgence on the Feast of the Presentation marking 40 days after Christmas Day Continuing our yearly parish tradition we will bless and offer Epiphany Chalk at all Masses next weekend to be taken home You are encouraged to use this sacramental as it invites God into our homes and places our families under His constant protection More information next weekend special Thank You to all those who worked so hard to ensure our Christmas Liturgies were so beautiful Our Decorating Committee put in many hours this past week to ensure the Church was decorated to the nines Our musicians Diane and Dianne spent much time preparing instrumental music along with our volunteer cantors and musicians Marita Catherine Nancy Larry Mike and Jill who provided the beautiful Christmas hymns at various Masses Eric Sam Alex and Audrey helped to construct our Cantor Box in the choir loft Many other hands especially Michelle in the parish office and Nathan have been invaluable help to me throughout our Advent and Christmas season An additional special Thank You to all those who participated in our Advent Food Drive Your generosity throughout the season helped to provide over an entire carload worth of food and other personal items to the Wells County Food Bank Well be continuing this tradition of collecting food and needed personal items for the food bank every Advent and Lent Our St Vincent de Paul Fund also supports the food bank with monetary donations at those times when monthly assistance requests made through the fund are low These contributions are listed as Donations in our monthly St Vincent de Paul Fund
