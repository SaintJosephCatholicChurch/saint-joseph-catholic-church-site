  "text": "Our Lord Jesus Christ King Of The Universe November 20 2022 Join us on Thanksgiving Day Thursday Nov 24th for Mass at 9 AM as we begin the day giving thanks to Almighty God There is no better way to begin this day of thankfulness than with the Eucharist which in Greek eucharisteo means to give thanks This weekend November 19th 20th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe commonly referred to as Christ the King This modern feast was established by Pope Pius XI during a time of great turbulence in the world following the First World War with the intention of re establishing the centrality of Jesus in public life It is an important reminder that our faith is never merely a private matter but that God desires us to recognize the Lordship of Jesus in our lives our societies and our countries Next weekend will bring us into a new year of the Lord's grace as we enter a new liturgical year and begin the season of Advent For the first time we will be giving a theme to our Advent season and the entire liturgical year Coming from Luke's Gospel Luke 111 14 our theme this coming year is the request of the disciples to our Lord Jesus Lord Teach Us To Pray This means that throughout Advent and the whole liturgical year we will have a special focus on prayer and ways to deepen our prayer lives As part of our preparation for the national Eucharistic Revival this year of prayer will culminate in one year's time with the celebration of Forty Hours Devotion following the Solemnity of Christ the King Nov 26th 28th 2023 Forty Hours which is a forty hour period of continuous prayer made before the Blessed Sacrament in solemn exposition is one of the many of various Catholic devotionals and traditions meant to aid us in our prayer Throughout this next year we hope to reveal and present many different types of devotionals and prayer traditions from our Faith Reaching into this great deposit of our spiritual tradition will help us to see the depths of the spiritual richness from which we can draw This is one of the beautiful aspects of our Faith as we are able to draw from so great a variety of sources to assist in deepening our spiritual lives Beginning in Advent we will be offering various opportunities to learn about and participate in many of these traditions from Lectio Divina to Praise and Worship to Adoration and so much more Our Parish Mission on Monday Dec 5th to Wednesday Dec 7th will look at prayer in both our personal and home life In deepening our prayer life we deepen our personal relationship with Jesus Christ In deepening our relationship with Him we are in turn sent out to evangelize and be a source of encounter to every person that we meet Local and International Giving special Thank You for your generosity towards our brothers and sisters in need both locally and internationally Locally the Karing for Kids Blessing Tree has only two ornaments left after last weekend Once you have the
