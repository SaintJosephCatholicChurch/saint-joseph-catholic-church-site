My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Blessed Trinity He proceeded from the Father and the Son And He is equal to them in all things He is a gift from the Father the Spirit of Truth He is the Ruah Yahweh the breath the animating Spirit of God The Holy Spirit is the Spirit that gives life the Spirit of love the Spirit of power the Spirit that empowers and moves us to action In the 1st Reading Acts 211 It was stated thus When the time for the Pentecost was fulfilled they were all filled with the Holy spirit and began to speak in tongues as the Spirit enabled them to proclaim They were filled with power and became men of action So we are called to be men and women boys and girls of action If you listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and act accordingly you will never fall away from Gods love and the shackles of the flesh will never dominate you The Holy Spirit will remind you of all that the Lord Jesus taught He will enlighten you and help you to understand our religion Then you will really accept Jesus as the Lord as St Paul told us in the 2nd Read ing today Thus in the 2nd Reading1 Cor 123b7 1213 Paul showing the power of the Holy Spirit said Brothers and sisters No one can say Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit There are different gifts but the same Spirit gives them to different people The gift given is always for the good of the Christian community not for the individual So we must not be jealous of one another We are working for the One Lord and God In the Gospel Jn 201923 Jesus breathed on the disciples and said to them Receive the Holy Spirit Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them and whose sins you retain are retained So it is the Holy Spirit that gives the power to forgive sin Today is really the birthday anniversary of the Church for the Church was born on Pen tecost Day in Jerusalem some 2000 years ago It was the establishment of the New Israel the Church you all of us With the help of the Spirit we will be able to embrace the 7 Gifts and the 12 Fruit of the Holy Spirit and practice them for our sanctification and salva tion Let us make effort to listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit Do your best also to avoid the sin against the Holy Spirit The Lord Jesus said if anyone commit sin against the Father or against the Son heshe will be forgiven but if anyone who sins against the Holy Spirit heshe will never be forgiven neither here on earth nor in the world to come So let us be very careful not to sin against the Holy Spirit May I ask you Which sin is the sin against the Holy Spirit Answer it in your mind In Theology there is what we call State of Obduracy It is a state when a sinner can no longer recognize sin as sin nor see good as good When heshe sees sin it appears good and good appears bad sinful So heshe goes on sinning and sinning and sin ning And as good appears evil heshe avoids good for it appears bad and sinful For such a person there is no possibility of repentance This kind of state is a state of sinful ness and so it becomes the sin against the Holy Spirit Is it clear So no particular sin or sins constitute the sin against the Holy Spirit but a state of sinfulness Such a state is called a state of OBDURACY OK In the Gospel Jn 201923 the Lord Jesus gave us power to avoid falling into the state of Obduracy if we make use of the Sacrament of Penance as often as we have the need of it Confession No one who truly confesses hisher sins and truly strives to avoid sin will ever fall into the horrible state of obduracy Do your best strive sincerely human weak ness notwithstanding you will be saved Struggle strive to avoid sin Trust God have Faith believe in the Lord Jesus Do good and you will be saved With the celebration of the Pentecost we come to the end of Easter period Ordinary Time resumes on Monday June 5 The Regina Cae1i prayer we pray during Easter pe riod at 6:00am 12 noon
