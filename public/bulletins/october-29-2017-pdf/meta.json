rissey Betty Meyer Ron Payne David Carr Ronnie Bonnie Burns Mi chael Green Dorothy Dottie Marbach and Rick Cotterman 30TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME OCTOBER 29TH 2017 YR From the Pastors Desk CALL TO LOVE OF GOD AND LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOR My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all We gather to day in this Church at Gods invitation to give our praise and thanks to Him our God who loves us Our God is a God of love We are made in the image and like ness of God So we too are creatures of love Let us pray today that we can return Gods gracious love by loving Him and those around us We can manifest this call for love of God and our neighbor by being generously to God and our neighbor through the gifts God has given to us He gave us those gifts to share them with our neighbors Generously praying for others known and unknown to Showering good wishes on people Giving to the poor Giving with love to the Annual Bishops Appeal These and many other ways are means of express love for God and for our neighbors or Parish Church projects Thus in the first reading Ex 222026 Of todays Liturgy we are reminded of the consequences of oppression which is absence of love of neighbor Let us listen to what God said You shall not molest or oppress an alien You shall not wrong any widow or orphan If ever you wrong them and they cry out to me I will surely hear their cry My wrath will flare up and I will kill you then your wives will be widows and your children orphans Wow These are chocking words which nobody will like to hear being addressed to him or her If we heed to Gods call of love there would no longer be the kind of oppression described in this first reading There are three kinds of love Romantic Love this kind of love is animalistic Filial Love love that exists between fathers and their children between mothers and their children between brothers and sisters And Agape Love the spiritual Love This is the love we are talking about There is what we call Piusness of Pius Johnness of John and Maryness of Mary Pius can change but Piusness does not change That is the one we should love in our neighbor the ness in our neighbor in your wife your husband your parents in your childchildren in everyone for the ness does not change Then in the Gospel Mt 223440 Gods message is clear We should love the Lord God with all our being and our neighbor as ourselves This statement of Jesus is actually a combination of what was written in books of Deuteronomy 65 love of God and in Leviticus 1918 love of neighbor So it is old law in the Old Testament But what is new is Jesus interlocking of these two commandments namely that one cannot be thought of without the other For without love of neighbor the love of God remains a sterile figment of the mind and without love of God love of neighbor may end up in a vague humanitarianism that usually does not last especially when faced with disap pointments and difficulties The love of God vertical love and love of neighbor horizontal love must go together in sound Christian Religion Let us therefore pray that todays readings will sink deeply into our hearts Let us also pray that we will re spond to the commandment to love one another and reach out to those in need For by so doing we hope to become models of faith and imitators of the Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself totally for our sakes He loved us He loves us and will continue to love us unconditionally God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 November 1st is a Holy Day of Obligation We shall have two Masses 7:00am and 7:00pm 2 November 2 is
