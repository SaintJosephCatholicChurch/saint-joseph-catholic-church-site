WHAT BELONGS TO CAESAR AND TO GOD WHAT BELONGSS TO GOD My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all Today is world Mission Sunday We are called upon to help in the spreading of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God We are called to be missionaries in diverse ways If we cannot go on mission we then need to help by supporting and sponsoring Mission work We can support by prayers by contributing to support and sponsor those are able to go on Mission So please give generously today to help in spreading the Gospel of the Kingdom of God We are citizens of two cities the earthly city and the heav enly city We are expected to do our duties in those two cities heaven and earth God bless you for being generous In the 1st Reading Is 451 46 We saw God as the Lord of the two cities He made use of king Cyprus a pagan king to restate his people the Israelites who were a con quered nation God makes use of anybody of his choice good or not so good or even the bad to accomplish his designs In the gospel Mt 221521 The Lord himself taught us to respect all authority even a bad government without supporting its evil deeds At the time of Jesus the Roman authority was ruling the Jewish people and in fact the whole world They suffered in the hands of Roman soldiers If you watch the film or DVD called Jesus of Nazareth you will see what cruelty the people underwent at that time When the Jewish authority asked Jesus a very implicatory corny and hypocritical question Is it lawful to pay tax to Caesar And they wanted Jesus to answer yes or no There is no way Jesus could answer the question yes or no without implicating Himself If Jesus answered yes pay tax to Caesar they would accuse him of joining the Roman authority in suppressing and maltreating them If he should say no do not pay tax to Caesar they would accuse him of rebellion and revolution For if they failed to pay tax the Roman authority would come and destroy their city You see the type of people Jesus was dealing with You as citizens of USA and heaven you must do your duties to these two cities But whenever the human authority over steps its bound we must not obey it for we must obey God first before we can obey man Children obey your parents but you must obey God first for he is the father of all the giver of everything To Him we must obey first before any other NB 1 The Solemnity of All Saints
