  "text": "OURTH UNDAY I RDINARY IME ANUARY 30 2022 This weekend January 29th 30th the Church celebrates the 4th Sunday in Ordinary Time This also means that we are just over a month away from Ash Wednesday March 2nd and the start of Lent May we use this time to prayerfully discern what the Lord may be asking us to give up or take up this coming Lenten season as a way to grow in relationship with Him This coming Wednesday February 2nd the Church celebrates the Presentation of the Lord or Candlemas This feast marks the fortieth day af ter Christmas According to the prescripts of the Law Leviticus 1214 this is when Jesus was presented in the Temple by the Blessed Virgin and St Joseph Luke 22240 As Simeon recognizes Jesus as a light to the world Luke 232 this feast day is associated with the blessing of candles At our 7:00PM daily Mass this Wednesday Feb 2nd we will bless the candles that will be used in church throughout the liturgical year as a part of our Candlemas celebration You are invited to bring any candles that you would like blessed for use in your homes This blessing of candles will include those candles which we use for the Blessing of Throats on the Feast of St Blaise patron saint of those who suffer from illnesses of the throat This Blessing of Throats will be offered after all Masses next weekend February 5th 6th ID OU NOW ATHOLICS OT ORSHIP ARY This is arguably one of the most common misconceptions held about the Catholic Faith That Catholics worship Mary Catholics of course do not worship Mary First we must understand the difference between worship and prayer Worship in its truest sense is adoration or latria and given to God alone Prayer on the other hand is a form of conversation and communication In prayer we can turn to God and to all those in union with Him We adore God alone but we can also give honor to and have a devotion for those who are now with Him in Heaven In prayer to Mary and the Saints we do not bypass Jesus Christ Instead we go to Him through Mary and the Saints asking them in our prayer or conversation to bring our intentions before the throne of Jesus in Heaven Why do we ask Mary and the Saints to do this in the same way that we ask loved ones to pray for us Because as St James reminds us The fervent prayer of a righteous person is very powerful James 516 And like St Paul we are not afraid to ask our fellow Christians to intercede for us cf 2 Thessalonians 31 Romans 1530 Turning to history we do not immediately find the topic of prayer directed to the Blessed Mother discussed in the writings of the Early Church Fathers Instead addressing the controversies of their day they are writing about and championing Marys perpetual virginity and her role as Mother of God or Theotokos To find her role as a prayerful intercessor in the early Church we instead quite appropriately turn to the prayers of the Church The oldest recorded Marian prayer the Sub tuum praesidium dates back to at least 250 AD Still prayed today its origins are believed to be from an ancient prayer that was used in the Churchs Christmas Liturgy throughout Egypt This is but one example of a multitude of hymns canticles and prayers composed throughout the ages that attest to the Churchs ancient practice of seeking intercession to Jesus through Mary As we have seen Catholics do not worship Mary Prayer to Mary is not worship which is given to God alone Instead prayer is a spiritual communication of love and petition to the Mother of Jesus who continues to care for the Mystical Body of her Son by her intercession MASS INTENTIONS
