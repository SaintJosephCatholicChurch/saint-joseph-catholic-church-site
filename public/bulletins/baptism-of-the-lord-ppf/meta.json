  "text": "APTISM HE ORD ANUARY 10 2021 This weekend Jan 9th 10th the Church celebrates the Baptism of the Lord This celebration will end the Christmas season and bring us into Ordinary Time There will however be a brief resurgence of Christmas on the Feast of the Presentation Feb 2nd which marks the fortieth day after Christmas Day Following the Law of Moses Leviticus 1214 the Blessed Virgin and St Joseph would have presented Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem forty days after his birth Luke 22138 Given how beautiful the church looks with our Christmas decorations we will keep the Christmas trees in our sanctuary until this resurgence of Christmas joy on the Feast of the Presentation Feb 2nd This not only allows us to enjoy the beauty of the church a bit longer but is also a joyous reminder that we are called to keep the Incarnation of Jesus Christ alive in our hearts The joy of the Incarnation is not meant to be isolated to only Christmas Day but is to be celebrated each and every day of our lives And how do we keep this celebration alive in our lives Remembering the words of St Teresa of Calcutta It is Christmas every time you let God love others through you As we move into Ordinary Time this Monday we are challenged by this concept of time So often we want to be in control of our time and to use it as we will The season of Ordinary Time however serves to reemind us that all time belongs to God As the creator of the universe all things including time itself belong to God We ourselves are His As we heard in our first reading God has formed us and has given us a purpose Isaiah 4214 67 We are to use this time that God has given every single moment of our lives to imitate Him and show forth His love This is why our time spent in worship is so important Worship provides us with an opportunity to give thanks to God for all His gifts and to teach us how to love LANNING IN THE EAR OF JOSEPH At our Parish Council meeting this past week we have begun to brainstorm ways to celebrate this new Year of St Joseph as proclaimed by Pope Francis As we enter into Ordinary Time we will offer our weekly Wednesday evening 7:00PM Mass as a special Votive Mass of St Joseph whenever possible This will occur every time that there is a ferial day on the Church calendar ferial day is any day within Ordinary Time when there is no special feast or memorial to be celebrated eg there is no specific Saints feast day celebrated on that calendar day On ferial days we have the option to celebrate a special votive Mass or a Mass celebrated for a special purpose While the daily readings will remain the same our prayers spoken in the liturgy specifically the Opening Prayer Collect the Prayer over the Offerings and the Prayer after Communion will make special mention of our parish patron St Joseph The special purpose of such a votive Mass is to increase our devotion to St Joseph This is similar to our Votive Mass of the Sacred Heart celebrated on the First Friday of the month meant to help increase our devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus In addition to the votive Mass we are also looking at other activities we can do as a parish This includes the possibility of a weekly Novena to St Joseph a parishwide consecration to St Joseph etc More to come Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday January 9 8:00am Special Intention 4:00pm
