YEAR From the Pastors Desk THE MYSTERY OF THE TRIUM GOD CANNOT BE FULLY COMPREHENDED My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all Remember 1 That we shall have Eucharistic Procession on June 18 the Solemnity of the Body and Blood of Christ after the 7:30am Mass Please make some effort to join in the Eucharistic Procession It is a way of professing our faith and expressing our love to the Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist May the Holy Spirit give you the courage and strength to join the Procession Amen And by joining you will be putting into action some of the Gifts and Fruit of the Holy Spirit you received 2 I will be out of town from June 19 to 23 2017 for Priests Annual Retreat at State Park at Angola Be assured I will pray for every one of you 3 I want to congratulate all our High School students who are graduating this year as we celebrate Baccalaureate Mass for you today So Congratulations to you all Today we celebrate The Ineffable Mystery of the Triune God For every Christian Catholic the most first probable thing we were taught by our parents about our Relig ion is the Trinity It is taught by teaching us the sign of the Cross It is the expression of the belief in the Triune God the three Persons in One God The Trinitarian doctrine is the most wonderful mystery we have in our religion It is the revelation of God as Fa ther Son and Holy Spirit It tells us what God is for us But about the mysterious unity of the THREE Father Son and Holy Spirit we cannot adequately and fully express it God cannot be completely comprehended by human concepts It is more important to relate with God than fully knowing Him An intimate persontoperson relationship with God gives us knowledge of God that cannot possibly be expressed in human word and terminology It is that kind of knowledge of God that satisfies a human being Oh how wonderful is the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God how un searchable are his ways God is One and God is Three In the 1st Reading Ex 344b6 1618 we saw the infidelity of the Israelites at Mount Sinai and Moses called them cc a stiffnaked people because they worshiped idols a molded gold calf We in our own time may not worship idols as such but we can be guilty of worshiping money or what money can buy or power or authority or pleasure of the flesh Despite their disobedience Moses intervened on their behalf be fore God and God accepted the apology of Moses and forgave them their sins There fore we must stop sinning When we stop sinning we will receive the blessings of God as we read in the 2nd Reading 2 Cor 131113 Paul said Brothers and sisters re joice mend your ways encourage one another agree with one another live in peace and God of love and peace will be with you He wished us the blessings of the Trinity the Three Persona in One God In the Gospel Jn 31618 The Trinity was implicitly mentioned God so love the world that He sent his Son Jesus Christ who saved us from our sins And after his Res urrection and ascension into heaven the Holy Spirit came and strengthened the Church The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth who taught us all things He came as Christ prom ised So we need to have faith and trust in the Father in the Son and in the Holy Spirit All three Persons are one the Triune God the Holy Trinity This is our faith We must believe in it for it is an axiomatic truth that needs no prove It is selfevidence God bless you I want to congratulate again all our High School students who are graduating this year So Congratulations to you all Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it God bless you Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu May your footsteps set you upon a lifetime journey of love May
