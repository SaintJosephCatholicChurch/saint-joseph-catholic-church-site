the Lateran Basilica November 9 2025 This weekend November 8th 9th the Church celebrates the Feast of St John Lateran This feast is one that is fairly unique in our liturgical year because it is a day that celebrates neither a saint or an event in salvation history Instead it celebrates a building The Basilica of St John Lateran dedicated to both St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist is the cathedral of Rome which is the primary church of the Bishop of Rome Most people think of St Peters Basilica in the Vatican City State as the cathedral of Rome but it is not St John Lateran located on the Lateran Hill hence its name holds the cathedra or chair of the bishop of Rome The cathedra signifies a bishops role as a successor to the Apostles and his authority to teach and govern within the church The church with the cathedra is considered the primary church and cathedral of that diocese The readings for this great feast help us to move from gratitude for treasured physical buildings like the Lateran Basilica to reflection on the true nature of the Church Although we call places of worship churches in actual fact the true sanctuary or place of worship is the Body of Christ which is the Church and His Mystical Body In this way every Christian is united to the Lord by faith and in the Sacraments Consecration to St Joseph We are officially kicking off our parish wide preparation this weekend for the upcoming Consecration to St Joseph Starting on the Feast of St John Lateran and ending on the Memorial of Our Lady of Loretto both of these days are liturgical celebrations with connections to buildings St John Lateran as previously mentioned is the cathedral church of Rome and the Holy House of Loretta is where the Blessed Virgin Mary was raised With these two feast days we are reminded that God sanctifies not only physical structures but also the living stones of His Church which is each one of us In the same way as we undertake this Consecration to conclude our parish's 150th Anniversary we are reminded that this anniversary is not simply about buildings or history Instead it is about the true strength of our parish Our faith in Jesus Christ who unites us as one family in His Church May this time of preparation renew our commitment to live out our Faith more deeply Our parish is not made up of only stone and concrete but holiness charity and trust in God's providence As we journey together toward our Consecration Day may we open our hearts to the example and protection of St Joseph just as our Lord Himself was entrusted to his care May St Joseph Guardian of the Redeemer lead us ever closer to Jesus Christ Rooted in gratitude for our 150 years of faith we now look to St Joseph as a model of holiness and trust in God's providence as we strengthen our foundation in Jesus Christ St Joseph Giving Table Thank You special Thank You to all those who supported the St Joseph Giving Table throughout this past summer and fall It's always a
