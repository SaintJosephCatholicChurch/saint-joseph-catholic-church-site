Ordinary Time August 17 2025 This weekend August 16th 17th the Church celebrates the Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time In our Gospel Jesus does something seemingly extreme He reminds us that there is a commitment higher than our family bonds that is the commitment to God himself Sometimes the commitment to God and family are mutually supporting Other times however these two commitments can be opposed to one another and cause conflict Ultimately the truth of the Faith are not things that can be negotiated in order to avoid family friction Even within the Jewish understanding familial ties could be morally repudiated for the sake of God This means that Jesus is essentially claiming His own divinity by stating that following after Him will cause familial division and that is acceptable because of who He is God Many of us know that this Gospel is not simply a thing of the past We may have faced the very reality proclaimed here in our own lives when choosing to live out our Catholic Faith Many of our family members and friends may not understand our choices or might even respond to it with outright hostility This is a form of the very division that our Lord is speaking of All these forms of conflict need to be borne in union with Christ who suf fered the Cross for us Ultimately the family of God trumps even our natural family My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it Luke 821 Our Gospel reminds us that as good as peace is Jesuss primary mission was not to establish social peace in this life Instead His mis sion was to reveal the narrow gate that leads to salvation Matt 713 14 Ministry Fair Next weekend there will be representatives from our many ministries in the narthex after all our Masses I encourage you to speak with the
