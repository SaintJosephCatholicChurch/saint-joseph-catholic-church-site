the Church celebrates the Sixth Sunday of Easter In addition our local parish is also celebrating First Holy Communion and May Crowning At our 10 AM Mass our six First Holy Communicants will for the first time approach the altar of the Lord's Sacrifice to receive the Holy Eucharist May we as a parish family continue to support and encourage our First Holy Communicants as they continue to grow in the Faith Speaking of growth I was recently asked how many baptisms we have had since the start of the year While recording last weekend's baptism in our parish's baptismal records I did a quick count Our parish has celebrated ten baptisms since January As of this moment we are also planning for at least three additional baptisms in the coming weeks and several more to follow in the summer months Are we as a parish growing Resoundingly Yes When a child is brought forth for baptism the ritual first acknowledges the joy that comes from their birth and addresses the parents and godparents as follows This community rejoices with you for today the number of those baptized in Christ will be increased How true it is that every baptism is not only a moment of great joy for each individual family but also for our entire parish family as another soul is claimed for Christ The ritual continues promising each family that our parish family will offer them our support in raising your child in the practice of the faith We see this promise being kept both with our First Holy Communicants today and the warm welcome we show to our many new families at Mass each weekend As the saying goes parish that isn't crying is dying Let us continue to support one another with great charity as we work together to pass on the Faith One of the ways we strive to hand on the Faith to our youth is through our Religious Education classes each year Last weekend our classes came to a close for the summer special Thank You to our volunteer catechists Youth Group team and Michelle our Director of Religious Education all of whom have given so generously of their time and talents throughout this past year Interested in volunteering next year Contact the Parish Office With the end of our Religious Education classes for this year our parish campus is beginning to transition into summer mode While we will still have a number of activities offered over the summer this is also a time for normal upkeep and maintenance for our buildings In addition to the normal efforts of maintaining our buildings we will also be looking to put new coats of paint in the parish gym the sacristy and the parish social hall and kitchen This work is made possible because of your support of our parish especially through our Repair Rainy Day Fund envelope Your financial support to this monthly collection helps to ensure the upkeep of our parish buildings for years to come On behalf of our entire parish family present and future who benefits from your support Thank you Baby Bottle Campaign Mother's Day
