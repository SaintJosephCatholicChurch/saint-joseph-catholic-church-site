  "text": "Second Sunday of Lent March 5 2023 This weekend March 4th 5th the Church celebrates the Second Sunday of Lent or Transfiguration Sunday Over the three year lectionary cycle for Sunday liturgies we hear from all three accounts of the Transfiguration in the Synoptic Gospels Matthew Mark and Luke on the Second Sunday of Lent Similar to the grace He bestows on the three the account of the Transfiguration is meant to prepare us for all that lies ahead as we begin our Lenten journey Moving south from Galilee to Judea for the coming Feast of Passover in Jerusalem Jesus ascends Mount Tabor in the Jezreel Valley found in the lower region of Galilee Before ascending to the top He first brings three along who are especially dear to Him Peter whom He has made the Rock James the first Apostolic martyr and John the beloved disciple He has resolved to take them aside and show them a glimpse of that glory which until that day fixed for its manifestation He conceals from the eyes of man The Transfiguration lasted only a few moments for Jesus mission was not on Mount Tabor but on Mount Calvary in Jerusalem Though the Lord bestows a great grace upon Peter James and John we know the great trial they themselves will still face when Jesus hour of trial comes In just a short time we find these same three fast asleep on the Mount of Olives even as our Lord's hour is close at hand When He is seized all including the three flee from Him It is only after the Resurrection that they are then able to approach Him in His great mercy Originally the season of Lent was meant as a time of final preparation for those preparing to enter into the Church on Easter Sunday This is seen quite beautifully in the writings of St Cyril the 4th Century Bishop of Jerusalem Speaking to the Catechumens of his day he poetically states Great is the Baptism that lies before you a ransom to captives a remission of offenses a death of sin a new birth of the soul St Cyril's twenty three Catechetical Lectures serve to instruct and encourage those preparing to encounter the Lord at Easter and are still well worth reading today This weekend this great tradition continues as it has for centuries as we send off our Catechumens and Candidates for Full Communion to the Rite of Election This yearly ceremony is a moment where those who have spent the past year preparing to enter the Church will be received by Bishop Rhoades at the Cathedral in Fort Wayne welcomed and assured of our prayers Over the next three weekends our Elect Abby Alexandria and Vanessa will also undergo the Scrutinies These are moments of deep prayer in the Mass that allow us as a parish family to pray for those who are preparing to enter or join the Church at the Easter Vigil The Lenten season also serves as an opportunity for us to retrace the steps of Jesus call in our own lives as we seek to more perfectly surrender our lives to Him each and every day St Joseph Novena This coming Friday March 10th marks the start of our annual St Joseph Novena Prayer These nine days lead us to the celebration of St Joseph's Day on March 19th Please see the insert in this week's bulletin for an explanation of what a novena is as well as the prayers for the St Joseph Novena I encourage you to pray for a specific intention close to your heart and follow along in the Novena prayer each day at home We will also recite the daily prayers together after our daily Masses throughout the week Lenten Trivia Violet Royal and Penitential Color Violet is the liturgical color of Lent Costly to make in ancient times violet came to be associated with kings and royalty Before His crucifixion soldiers clothed Jesus in a cheap robe made of fake violet dye intending to imply that Jesus was a fake king not knowing they were about to crucify the King of Kings In addition to being the color of royalty violet is also the color of repentance for sins and symbolizes the state of our souls without the light of Christ The color also symbolizes our mourning for Jesus sacrifice MASS INTENTIONS Saturday March 4 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Parish Family Sunday March 5
