  "text": "Fourteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 9 2023 This weekend July 8th 9th the Church celebrates the Fourteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Thank you for your generous support of our brothers and sisters from the Archdiocese of Tabora in Tanzania last weekend Like many of you I greatly enjoyed the chance to meet Fr Patrick Bergin and to hear about the Faith being lived out so vibrantly in Tanzania mission talk is not only meant to raise awareness of and support for those in need it also serves as a poignant reminder for each of us We are called to not only recognize the many blessings in our lives but also to recognize the true gift of God's grace given to us in our Faith that we often take for granted Just as we had an opportunity to share our material support with those in Tabora may we also now learn from and share in their spiritual zeal for the Faith If you would like to make a donation for the Archdiocese of Tabora please place additional donations in a plain envelope marked Mission Appeal in the collection basket Checks should be made out to St Joseph Catholic Church Next weekend we welcome Fr Bill Sullivan as the celebrant for our weekend Masses As I will be traveling with those on our day pilgrimage to the Shrine of the Holy Relics on Saturday Fr Bill offered to cover not only our Saturday anticipatory Mass but our full weekend schedule of Masses As always I greatly appreciate Fr Bill's help and thank you for your warm welcome to him With Fr Bill offering our Masses this weekend I will be traveling to nearby St Rose of Lima in Monroeville on Sunday to join in the installation of their new pastor Fr Dennis DiBenedetto Fr Dennis was able to join us for my installation as pastor five years ago I am happy to be able to return the favor and join his new parish family in celebrating his installation as pastor next weekend Coming Soon Totus Tuus Summer Program In two weeks we will welcome the missionaries leading our upcoming Totus Tuus Summer Program These missionaries have given up their summers to lead this great program throughout our diocese This program is not only meant to engage our youth but our entire parish family Join us for a parish potluck to welcome the missionaries on Tuesday July 25th at 5:00PM in the Social Hall It's not too late to sign up your children or grandchildren for Totus Tuus which will run from July 23rd 28th Registration forms are available in the Parish Office and can be returned either in the collection basket or to the Parish Office The missionaries will join us for our weekend Masses on July 22nd 23rd to offer a personal invitation for the week's events Did You Know The Sacrament of Confession The Sacrament of Confession was instituted by Jesus Christ to provide a means for those who fall into sin after Baptism to be restored into Gods grace It involves the admission of ones sins made to a duly approved Priest in order to obtain absolution Confession is often called the sacrament of Penance as the recipient must be truly repentant of his sins be determined to try to avoid this sin in the future and be willing to make reparations as appropriate for his actions This Sacrament is the way in which God has chosen to administer forgiveness Jesus exercised the power to forgive sins so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins Matthew 86 And to the Apostles Jesus says As the Father has sent Me so I send you And when He had said this He breathed on them and said to them Receive the Holy Spirit Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them John 2021 23 The Catholic Priest in the Sacrament of Confession does not redeem us he is instead an agent of the one Mediator Jesus and is assigned and empowered by this one Mediator Confession is but one way of applying the mediation of Christ to men In this way the Sacrament of Confession allows us to confess our sins to God through His minister following the way in which Jesus Himself instituted If you haven't been to Confession in a while I invite you to participate in this beautiful sacrament of healing You'll be surprised about how free you feel after Saturday July 8 8:00am Special Intention
