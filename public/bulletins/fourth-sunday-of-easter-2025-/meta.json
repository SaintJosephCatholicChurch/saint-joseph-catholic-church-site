latter name is taken from the Gospel reading which always includes an account of Christ as the Good Shepherd on this weekend This reading marks a shift in our Gospel readings Having focused on concrete events in Jesus Resurrection accounts our emphasis now moves to Jesus teachings about his impending Ascension and sending forth the gift of the Holy Spirit given at Pentecost We also celebrate Mother's Day this weekend We wish a Happy Mother's Day to our mothers grandmothers godmothers and all women who have reflected a motherly love to us throughout our lives In the words of our late Holy Father Pope Francis Mothers are always witnesses of tenderness dedication and moral strength Dearest mothers thank you for what you are in your family and for what you give to the Church and the world After Mass this weekend we have a special gift of carnations to give to the women of our parish as a sign of our love and gratitude for you Thank you for your presence in our lives and for how you live out in your own God given way the great gift of motherhood in your lives These carnations also support women throughout our area as a fundraiser for Northeast Indiana Right to Life which our parish supports through our St Vincent de Paul Fund Habemus Papam We Have a Pope Following the start of the Papal Conclave this past Wednesday the Cardinal Electors elected Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost OSA as the 267th Roman Pontiff to ascend the Chair of St Peter native of Chicago Cardinal Prevost has taken the papal name Leo XIV as he undertakes the Petrine Ministry Starting with our Mass of Thanksgiving offered this past Thursday we will once again hear the name of the Pope mentioned in the Eucharistic Prayer now praying for Leo our Pope as a sign of our communion with the universal Church under his pastoral leadership Parish Council This past Wednesday our Parish Council held its final meeting of the year We will take our annual break over the summer months before we resume monthly meetings in August We extend a heartfelt Thank you to Chris Hartman and Sarah McCorkle who have completed their three year term on the Council Their leadership and dedication to our parish have been deeply appreciated Nominations to fill these two vacancies will open in June Sacristy Painting special Thank You to parishioners Twilla Herr and Nancy Wagner for their work in helping to paint and beautify the Sacristy As I often highlight in our annual Teaching Mass 1 every aspect of a church building itself is meant to help draw us to prayer and 2 our prayer begins long before the Sign of the Cross at the beginning of Mass The Sacristy serves as a place of prayer for the priest altar servers and various ministers as we prepare for Mass To aid in this preparation the very Sacristy itself should help to draw our hearts up to the heavens The stars on the ceiling serve this purpose drawing our gaze to the Kingdom of God On the beam Psalm 434 is written I will go to the altar of God to God who gives joy to my youth This psalm similarly is meant to draw our minds and hearts towards that heavenly mountain and help prepare our ascent to the altar of God In Christ Fr

to the Church PIRITUAL OTHERHOOD Alice von Hildebrand I never had the incredible privilege of having children of my own yet last year I was bombarded with Mother's Day cards and wishes If you don't have children for goodness sake don't believe that you have to give up motherhood Motherhood is not only biological maternity It is spiritual maternity There are hundreds of people all around who are desperately looking for a mother number of people have come to me to tell me about their problems I listen to them And I love them And I say very little But they know that I care for them In this sense I have become their mother Therefore it's not a matter of either having biological or legally adopted children or being childless No mother is the very essence of femininity We have got to be mothers It's interesting that sometimes even little girls already understand this in the way they help their little sister or brother I totally reject the idea that you are not a mother unless you have children of your own Last year I was kept busy answering all the good wishes for Mother's Day Your vocation is the same If you are married that is wonderful And if you are not married but one day God sends you the right man gladly and gratefully accept him But your motherhood should come long before that Pray to God that he sends you spiritual children Spiritual motherhood is more important than biological motherhood There are plenty of women who are biological mothers and yet are not mothers at all Some consider their child to be a nuisance and an accident saying I didn't want it Take for instance women who have an abortion for convenience's sake God offers them a tremendous gift but they say No I don't want it it's going to disturb me From now on your daily prayer should be God send me spiritual children and I will never turn any one of them down The more the better Simple as that Pray for the gift of spiritual children It might very well be that in your beautiful desire to be a biological mother you have overlooked cases where you could have become a spiritual mother Many of my students became my spiritual children even though they were young adults already You are called to motherhood right now Not next week not next month I'm absolutely convinced that God has placed people in your path and called you to motherhood Your task is to love those that are weak unhappy helpless and unloved Sometimes you can do this just by saying one word At other times you'll just have to listen In every life there is suffering most people keep it inside When they feel loved they will open up and tell you about their suffering Then you will find that by carrying other people's suffering your own suffering becomes lighter Dr Alice von Hildebrand was a 20th Century Catholic philosopher and theologian She taught philosophy at Hunter College for four decades and wrote several books before her passing in January of 2022 This article is based on an interview that Dr Von Hildebrand gave to Vivian Warren Shannon McPherson and Erna Albertz on May 5 2015 Knights of Columbus Father Aloysius Phillips Council 7555 Saint Joseph was a just man a tireless worker the
