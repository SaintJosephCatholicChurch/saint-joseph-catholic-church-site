  "text": "Sixth Sunday of Easter May 22 2022 This weekend the Church celebrates the Sixth Sunday of Easter On Thursday we will mark the fortieth day since Easter Sunday and celebrate the Ascension of the Lord Luke 2446 53 In the United States our national Bishops Conference has transferred this celebration to next Sunday to help ensure that as many as possible can join in its celebration Traditionally the three days leading to Ascension Thursday were referred to as Minor Rogation Days Already considered an ancient practice by the beginning of the 6th Century these were seen as days of prayer and fasting This helped to prepare the Faithful for Ascension Thursday and was an intentional opportunity to beseech God for a good and bountiful harvest going into planting season Given how ancient the use of a liturgical calendar is the dating of many of our celebrations are themselves placed around the practices of an agrarian society For example the yearly date of Easter Sunday is set around the vernal equinox Minor Rogation Days falling nearly forty days after Easter Sunday will always then fall near the beginning of the planting season Such practices are meant to help us lift every action most especially our daily work up to God The Summer and Visiting Priests As a reminder next weekend will be my last weekend at St Joseph's for the summer After our Masses next weekend I will begin the drive to Washington DC where I will be completing my studies at the Catholic University of America I look forward to returning to our parish after my classes are completed in the beginning of August For the first two weekends that I am away we will be receiving assistance from priests throughout the Decatur and Fort Wayne area From the third weekend throughout the remainder of the summer a priest will be assigned in residence to our parish until I return in August I will include a list of our visiting priests for the summer in next weekend's bulletin column As always thank you ahead of time for warmly welcoming our visiting priests Parish Easter Gift For the 121 families who had signed up for our parish Easter gift the crucifixes have arrived Each family was contacted by the Parish Office this past week If you've chosen to pick up your crucifix they are available in the Parish Conference Room after our weekend Masses If you've requested that I personally deliver their crucifix and bless your home I will be contacting you this week to arrange a visit Did You Know The Council of Jerusalem Our first reading today Acts 151 2 22 29 speaks of the first Church council known as the Council of Jerusalem As we hear a dispute arose regarding the necessity of circumcision the sign of the Old Covenant for Gentile converts to Christianity To settle this matter a group led by Sts Paul and Barnabas go to Jerusalem and seek the guidance of the Apostles Acts 157 tells us that after there had been much debate St Peter rose and addressed the assembly He recounts how God made His choice among you that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe indicating his role as the head of the Apostles He then proposes the divinely revealed dogma that the council put forward as its decision As the council sends forth this decision it is clearly stated that it is the decision of the Holy Spirit and of us the Apostles and presbyters gathered together Acts 1528 The Council of Jerusalem serves as the model for the next 21 Church Councils the latest being the Second Vatican Council This is one way that the Church serves in Her role as the Magisterium or teacher of the Faith through the guidance of the Holy Spirit Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday May 21 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm
