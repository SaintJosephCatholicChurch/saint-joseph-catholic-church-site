  "text": "Second Sunday of Advent December 4 2022 This Thursday December 8th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception a Holy Day of Obligation To help meet our obligation of assisting at Mass on the holy day a Vigil Mass will be offered on Wednesday Dec 7th at 7 PM as a part of the Parish Mission and Masses will be offered on Thursday Dec 8th at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM This weekend December 3rd 4th the Church celebrates the Second Sunday of Advent Continuing in the first half of Advent our focus remains on Christ's Second Coming at the end of time Traditionally this focus has been emphasized as seen on bulletin cover through meditation on the four last things Death Judgment Hell and Heaven Far from being morbid reflecting on what will happen to our souls at the moment of our death can do us much good When we contemplate the life that awaits us it will help us to increase our faith hope and love for God and our desire to be with Him forever In the words of St Alphonsus Liguori The business of eternal salvation is to us the most important of all affairs Death is that separation of mans mortal body and immortal soul It comes to all men as a result of original sin It is a temporary state for at the end of the world all men shall rise again to be judged by Christ At the moment of death itself each human person is judged by God based on his conduct in this life and goes immediately to his reward or punishment personal judgment Moreover at the end of the world Jesus Christ will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead final judgment Heaven is the eternal state of perfect happiness resulting from the face to face vision of God which is the reward of those who have served Him in this life Hell is the eternal state of despair and separation from God which awaits those who in this life have freely turned away from and rejected Him Next Sunday or Gaudate Sunday I invite you to join me in wearing rose to Mass Rose a liturgical color worn twice a year is a mixture of the penitential violet of Advent with the celebratory gold of Christmas reminding us to Rejoice because we are preparing for Christ Our penitential seasons are always meant to lead us to a time of celebration Or in the sentiment of Ven Fulton Sheen Advent and Lent always start with a fast to prepare us for the feast that is to come Included in this weekend's bulletin is a double sided insert On one side is our yearly treatment of the Immaculate Conception as revealed in the Sacred Scriptures It is my hope that this exegesis may be useful to both you and any family and friends who may wonder why the Church has for the past two thousand years held our Blessed Mother in such high esteem On the other side is a short history of and some interesting facts surrounding the life of St Nicholas the 4th Century Bishop of Myra which is in modern day Turkey St Nicholas feast day falls this Tuesday December 6th The various accounts of generosity attributed to St Nicholas is believed to be the roots of our own cultural approach to gift giving on Christmas Day The Bells of St Joseph New Carillon Edition Over our Thanksgiving Holiday our new carillon system from Chime Master was installed Our previous system after 34 faithful years of service rang the call to Mass one last time before being retired It was able to play about half of the song before giving out The new system which is digital and has a vast library of hymns was easily installed As a nod to our parish patron the first hymn the new carillon rang out was St Joseph was a Quiet Man set to Kingsfold or I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say With a bevy of additional features the new system should serve our parish well for many years Thank you again for your continued support of our monthly Rainy Day Fund that made this unexpected but needed repair possible Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday December 3 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary
