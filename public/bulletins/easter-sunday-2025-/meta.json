Sunday of the Resurrection of the Lord April 20 2025 Christ is risen Truly He is risen Alleluia Alleluia Whether this is your first time visiting with us or if you are a life long parishioner we rejoice to celebrate Easter with you Thank you for joining us as we celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ We no longer fear death for the death of our Savior has set us free For this reason Easter is not just an event that is to be remembered but a reality to be lived everyday of our lives With the reality of Easter our Easter Sunday celebrations continue for the rest of the week in the Easter Octave This joy cannot be contained in a single day Instead the joy of Christ's Resurrection echoes anew each day The full Easter Season or Eastertide lasts for fifty days These fifty days of Easter joy should be lived just as intensely as we lived out the past forty days of preparatory prayer fasting and almsgiving during Lent Congratulations to our two Elect Kim and Thiago and our three Candidates for Full Communion Brittney Cole and Sydnee coming into the Church this Easter Season We rejoice together as a parish family as our family continues to grow special Thank You to the godparents and sponsors of our Elect and Candidates and to Jill our RCIA Coordinator for the diligent preparation they've helped provide throughout this past year Though we have entered into the Easter Season our Catholicism Explained series will continue for two more weeks During this time those who have entered into the Church enter into a period known as mystagogy meaning to lead through the mysteries This practice traced back to at least the fourth century invites those who have just received the Sacraments at Easter to reflect on the life changing graces that they have received This concept of mystagogy is useful for each of us to consider How often do we approach the Sacraments without pausing to reflect on the true gift that they are These outward signs of inward grace have been given to us by Jesus Himself to strengthen our relationship with Him This Easter Season is the perfect time to reflect on these gifts of grace and ask the Lord to use them in renewing our hearts as we journey together towards the Resurrection Easter Egg Hunt Parish Potluck Next Sunday April 27th we celebrate the Octave Day of Easter known as Divine Mercy Sunday Just as we have had our Easter celebrations with our families so now we continue our celebrations together as a parish family Join us next Sunday after the 10 AM Mass for our annual Parish Easter Potluck and Easter Egg Hunt The parish will provide the main entre and drinks You are invited to bring your favorite side dish to share Please see the sign up in the narthex Confirmation Celebrations At the end of the month we will welcome Bishop Rhoades to our parish to celebrate the Sacrament of Confirmation for our 8th Grade Confirmandi Our twelve Confirmandi will be joined by the Confirmandi from St Aloysius as they prepare to receive the fruits gifts of the Holy Spirit and be sent forth as missionary disciples Please keep them in prayer as this great day approaches special Thank You also to all those who helped make our Easter celebrations so special Our Choir and Youth Schola both under the direction of our choir director Teresa helped to elevate our hearts and minds to the Lord not only in Holy Week but throughout
