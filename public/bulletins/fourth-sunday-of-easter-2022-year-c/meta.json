  "text": "Fourth Sunday of Easter May 8 2022 This weekend the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday of Easter As this Sunday's Gospel references the theme of the Good Shepherd regardless of which year of the Lectionary cycle we are in it is also called Good Shepherd Sunday In 1964 it also received a third name as Pope St Paul VI established it as the World Day of Prayer for Vocations Our nation adds a fourth name to this weekend as well Mother's Day In 1914 President Woodrow Wilson established the second Sunday of May as Mother's Day which is a public expression of love and reverence for the mothers of our country We wish a happy Mother's Day to all of the mothers of our parish Whether the mother of a child grandmother adoptive mother aunt godmother spiritual mother and all those who share in any way in the vocation of motherhood know of our love and gratitude for you How beautiful it is that both our Church and national celebrations can be seen to overlap this weekend in ultimately the celebration of vocations Priesthood Religious Life Married Life Motherhood Fatherhood and Consecrated Single Life This is a great reminder that each of us no matter who we are is called by the Lord In the words of our Holy Father Pope Francis God has a plan for each of you to discover that plan and to respond to your vocation is to move toward personal fulfillment The Lord calls each of us to aid in His ministry To be His presence His hands and His feet to the world In our vocation we live out this call and help to bring the beauty of Christ to the most unexpected places Baby Bottle Campaign This weekend we begin our yearly Baby Bottle Campaign to support Helping Hands a local pregnancyfamily resources center Baby Bottles are available in the Narthex and can be returned through Father's Day weekend Catholic University of America Summer Studies Though it's been some time since I last mentioned my CUA courses they have continued This past week I completed my final exam for the Spring semester and our course in Roman Law Providing a historical overview of the Roman legal system dating back 2800 years we saw how the system developed over time and how it heavily influenced our own legal systems today both in the Church and throughout the modern world In addition to completing the semester I also received confirmation that my summer semester will resume meeting in person This means that throughout June and July I will once again be away in Washington DC for studies At the end of July I will be taking my oral candidacy exam which is the culmination of these past four years of studies Once I return home in August I will begin working on my dissertation for the licentiate degree During my absence this summer the Bishop will be assigning a priest to St Joseph I do not yet know who our temporary summer associate will be but I look forward to sharing with them some of the good things that they can expect to be a part of I will also be returning several times throughout the summer to celebrate a number of Sacraments that have already been planned in the parish weddings and for the diocese ordinations Though my studies aren't yet finished I will start work with our Tribunal this coming September As one of our Advocates in the Tribunal is going to Rome for further studies I've been asked to assist the Tribunal staff during her absence throughout the next year Thankfully this additional assignment will not greatly affect my ministry here It does mean however that I will need to dedicate one day a week to working at our Tribunal in Fort Wayne Otherwise the rest of my time will continue to be dedicated to our parish Faithfully in Christ Fr David Please Note Next weekend I will be away to visit with my extended family special
