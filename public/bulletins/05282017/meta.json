INTO HEAVEN WE WILL BE WITH HIM THERE My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all Remember that Sunday coming is the Pentecost Sunday Solemnity of the Holy Spirit Remember also to continue to do some Novena Prayer to the Holy Spirit If you have not started you can begin today and do 7 days Novena You can use any prayer of your choice Please do something at least use one Hail Mary It is better than doing nothing The Lord Jesus ascended into heaven The important thing here is heaven Really for some people heaven means nothing to them When death comes they just died and that is the end for them There are some others for whom heaven is very important No mat ter how we live our life here on earth we can make use of all the wonders science and technology can provide to achieve better life seek the best medical care available yet in our best and lucid moments we know that there must be something more than all of these and that thing is a transcending reality It is by having faith in the Lord Jesus that we can see the transcending reality in a loving Father who waits for our arrival into his kingdom Jesus is the beginning and the end He is our head where he has gone we his members hope to follow So let us follow him into the new creation His Ascension into heaven is our glory and our hope For if Christ has not ascended into heaven we would be the most unfortunate peoples in the world Our faith would have been hope lessness But our hope is heaven Heaven is a reality though not a place up there in space It is rather a state a state of blessedness The ascension of the Lord is not a fairy tale It is a historical event that took place in time and it is a true story as stated in the 1st Reading Acts 1111 As they were look ing on he was lifted up and the cloud took him from their sight While they were look ing two men stood beside They said This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will return in the way as you have seen him go into heaven So be lieve it for it is a historical fact Thus Ascension is the glorification of Christ the Lord The Ascension took place on a mountain as we read in the Gospel Mt 281620 Matthew the Evangelist is trying to show us Christ Divinity God appeared to Moses on Mount Sinai Ex 19 The great sermon of Jesus the 8 Beatitudes took place on a mountain Mt 51 His transfiguration was on mountain Tabor Mt 17 1 And Jesus final appearance was also on a mountain Take home question On what mountain was His final appearance All the appearances of Jesus after his death and resurrection are the revelation of him as the Lord of all That was why they worshiped him whenever he appeared to them And finally the Lord Jesus gave them and us a mandate to teach the whole world baptize them and sanctify them Are we doing that He promised to be with us till the end of time Do you believe it and hold on it He is with us in the Eucharist Let each and every one of us work hard in doing good and be saved God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it SCRIPTUREMASS READINGS FOR THE WEEK Mon May 29 Seventh Week of Easter Memorial Day
