in Ordinary Time November 16 2025 This weekend November 15th 16th the Church celebrates the Thirty third Sunday in Ordinary Time This marks the penultimate weekend before the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe and the ending of our liturgical year Though with the snow this past week I'm sure that many minds and hearts are already focused on the Christmas season Let us not forget however that this coming season of joy is not yet here In our culture we often struggle with periods of preparation When everything is already at our fingertips we want to begin everything right now Yet in the liturgical life we are not meant to go at our own pace but to follow after that pace which was set by the Master Himself as we follow after His life Before we can celebrate the true joy of Christmas the birth of Jesus Christ we like the Christ child in the womb must enter a time of silent growth The practice of trying to live our life around the liturgical year serves as a beautiful reminder Our life is not our own When we allow the rhythm of the liturgical year to shape our daily life we begin to see more clearly how the Lord is at work in our life Even when nothing seems to be happening God's grace is silently working on our hearts May we welcome this invitation to stillness to help fill us with a renewed longing for the coming of Jesus Christ This does not mean that we cannot enjoy the simple trappings of the coming holiday seasons in anticipation of what is to come We have little control over many things including stores being decorated music being played and the many gatherings that begin to fill our calendars As disciples however we are invited to balance this anticipation with preparation Do not allow our outer busyness to upset the inner stillness of our heart that we are being invited into Instead let us strive to cultivate that inner stillness which keeps us rooted in Christ If we can preserve even a small space of silence each day in prayer reading Scripture or a nightly examen we will allow the Lord to shape in us a heart that is ready to welcome Him into the world And when the Christmas season finally arrives we will celebrate it with a joy that flows from having walked faithfully with the Church toward the coming of our King Parish Renovation General Update On Thursday November 6th I had the opportunity to sit down with team members from both Shawnee Construction and William Heyer Architecture I left that meeting extremely excited about our upcoming renovations Both teams are working together flawlessly as things quickly fall into place There are just a few moving pieces left to be nailed down before we make the upcoming renovation timeline public What I can share at this time is that our Christmas celebrations will be the our last large liturgical celebrations in the Church When renovations do begin we will plan to celebrate our weekend Masses Saturday 5 PM Vigil Sunday 730 10 AM in the Parish Social Hall and our weekday Masses times of Adoration in the Parish Conference Room We have already begun planning how to make these transitions as smooth as possible More to come soon Forty Hours Devotion When we conclude our Consecration to St Joseph on December 10th our parish will first enter into our third annual Forty Hours Devotion As with previous years our devotion will begin with Mass on December 8th at 7 PM and conclude with Mass on December 10th at 7 PM We will also welcome a guest speaker on Tuesday December 9th at 7 PM Throughout all the hours in between our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament will be exposed for adoration This time of prayer spent before our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament will help draw our hearts into deeper silence and gratitude in preparation for our consecration to St Joseph Over these many hours we invite every parishioner individuals families and ministries to come and rest in the presence of Jesus May this dedicated time of adoration rekindle within us a renewed love for the Eucharist and open our hearts to the graces of God Saturday November 15 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm June Gazdik Sunday November 16 7:10am Rosary 7:30am Our Parish Family 9:40am
