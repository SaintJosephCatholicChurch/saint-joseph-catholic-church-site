Easter Octave comes to a close as the Church celebrates the Octave Day of Easter and Divine Mercy Sunday Each day of the Easter Octave has been celebrated as if it was Easter Sunday itself exemplifying that the joy of Easter cannot be contained by a single day The Easter Octave itself gives way to Eastertide as our celebration of the resurrection continues Even when Eastertide comes to a close following the Ascension of the Lord and Pentecost our celebration of Easter is never far away from us Every Sunday throughout the year shares in the joy of Easter Sunday In the 4th Century St Augustine of Hippo referred to every Sunday as a sacrament of Easter and St Jerome stated very clearly that every Sunday is the day of the resurrection it is the day of Christians it is our day For this reason Christians gathered throughout the centuries every Sunday for to celebrate Mass The earliest Christians like many that are still suffering persecution today we willing to give their lives to gather for Mass In AD 304 the Martyrs of Abitinae in North Africa told their Roman persecutors Without fear of any kind we have celebrated the Lord's Supper on Sunday because it cannot be missed We cannot live without the Lord's Supper This seeming fearlessness in the face of persecution and martyrdom shows forth the strong belief in the resurrection of our early brothers and sisters in Christ They believed as we do today that not only has the Lord risen from the dead but that He invites us to participate in His resurrection In the words of St Ignatius of Antioch in AD 110 on Sunday we recognize that day on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by His death Liturgically this hope is reflected in our Paschal Candle Blessed at the Easter Vigil this candle a symbol of Christ stands burning brightly next to the ambo throughout the Easter season It is marked with the Alpha and Omega reminding us that Jesus is the beginning and the end and the current year 2024 as all times belong to Him special Thank You to parishioner Nancy Wagner who has painted our Paschal Candle over the past several years Following in our theme this year Living Life Liturgically she incorporated elements of the liturgical year into this year's Paschal Candle including the Nativity of the Lord the Crucifixion and the Resurrection as well as many of the liturgical colors marking the different seasons throughout the year special Thank You to our Religious Education Classes for the Alleluia banner that has hung above the main entryway in the narthex throughout the Easter Octave Each class spent time decorating a letter to help spell out Alleluia Just before Ash Wednesday the letters were collected and hidden away just as the Alleluia itself was hidden from our lips throughout the entirety of Lent Having entered the Easter season Alleluia has returned to our lips as we proclaim it together before the Gospel reading In the same way this Alleluia banner decorated by our children has risen from the grave and greets us as we enter the Church To paraphrase Pope St John Paul II we are an Easter people and alleluia is meant to be our song This word of course is a liturgical Hebrew word that means Praise the Lord Adult Confirmations with Bishop Rhoades On Sunday June 2nd Bishop Rhoades will offer a Mass for adults in need of the Sacrament of Confirmation at the
