begin your day with the Eucharist Greek for Thanksgiving as we give thanks to God from whom comes all our blessings Today the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe Established by Pope Pius XI in his encyclical Quas Primas follow ing the First World War this yearly feast day is meant to ensure that the king ship of our Savior should be as widely as possible recognized and hasten the return of society to our loving Savior We need Jesus Christ in every aspect of our lives Once men recognize both in private and in public life that Christ is King society will at last receive the great blessings of real liberty wellordered discipline peace and harmony Jesus is meant not only to rule over our society our country and our Church but also our hearts May we strive everyday of our lives to be worthy faithful and obedient subjects of the Divine King who reigns eternally and invites us into relationship with Himself This solemnity also marks the end of our liturgical year As we walk along the life of our Blessed Lord anew each year we are reminded that all things begin and end in Christ Throughout this past year we have walked together through the Gospel of St Luke Directed towards a Gentile audience St Luke focused his gospel on Jesus as the Son of Man Entering into our new liturgical year we will now hear from the Gospel of St Matthew St Mat thew writes his gospels directed towards a Jewish audience and as such will focus on Jesus as the King of Israel We will begin to walk with our Blessed Lord in St Matthews Gospel starting next weekend as we begin the Church year anew on the First Sunday of Advent Advent is the beginning of our new liturgical year and serves as our time to prepare for Christs coming or better yet to allow Christ to prepare our hearts for His coming We prepare both to celebrate His Incarnation that historical day when the Word was made flesh and His future coming in glory at the end of time These two celebrations will be reflected throughout our Ad vent readings The first two weekends of Advent our readings focus on the sec ond coming of Christ Then from December 17th to 24th our readings pre pare us to commemorate His first coming on Christmas Day As a time of preparation Advent though brief is a penitential season This is reflected in our very liturgy itself as our Church decorations and music take on a simpler tone As in Lent the Priest wears violet vestments as violet is a penitential and mournful liturgical color One additional change we will introduce this Advent in our liturgical decoration is the use of wooden can dlesticks and matching altar crucifix on our altar to help us better enter into the noble simplicity of this season Our beautiful metal candlesticks and matching altar crucifix from the original church on Cherry Street will return to us on Christmas Day as all things join together to rejoice in the Good News of Jesus Christ entering the world special Thank You to our master craftsman Joe Bauer for his dedicated work in crafting these new candlesticks As always in liturgy and in life all things should serve to point us to Christ I invite you as we prepare to began this Advent season to use the com ing weeks to enter more deeply into the mystery of our Lord As hectic as time of year can be we must not lose sight of the true reason for the season Instead let us deepen our relationship with the Lord What are some practical ways to do this Commit to attending one daily Mass each week Stop in the Church throughout the week for time in prayer Meditate upon the Scriptures for fifteen minutes everyday Take home and follow in the Little Blue Book the parish provides every year Join in our Advent Bible Study that will begin next Saturday Nov 30th at
