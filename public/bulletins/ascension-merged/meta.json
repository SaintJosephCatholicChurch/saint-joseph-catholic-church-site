On July 6th we will welcome Fr Tommy Lane for the remainder of the month My great gratitude goes out to both Fr Silvino and Fr Tommy for their as sistance at our parish during my absence this summer Also thank you ahead of time for the warm welcome and hospitality that I know you will show both of them over these coming weeks By the time you read this bulletin column I will be on the way to Wash ington DC for the summer Over the next two months I will be living at Theo logical College which is a diocesan seminary adjacent to the Catholic University of America campus Before leaving however I will have the chance to join many of the priests and faithful of our diocese in celebrating the Mass of Ordination for our three new priests Fr Jose Fr Dan and Fr Spenser Fr Jose and Fr Dan will begin their assignments as associate pastors within our diocese in the coming weeks Fr Spenser will assist at a parish during the summer before returning to the North American College in Rome for one final year of seminary studies Next year he will return home to our diocese and will be assigned as an associate pastor to one of our parishes As is seen in the ordination of these three young men our diocese has been blessed with a wonderful problem many priestly vocations Since my own ordination only three years ago with my two classmates we have had an addi tional ten young men ordained to the priesthood of Jesus Christ for our diocese In these ordinations we see the Church continuing in the promise of the Father Acts 14 as St Luke speaks of in our first reading Acts 11 11 Through the laying on of hands 1 Timothy 414 the priest is imbued with the Holy Spirit and the Churchs authority given by Christ continues in the world And as St Paul writes to the Ephesians in our second reading Ephesians 117 23 this same Church is the body of Christ These two readings help emphasize a reflection St Augustine wrote on the Ascension in the 4th Century Jesus is our head and we are His body No one but Christ descended and no one but Christ ascended not because there is no dis tinction between the head and the body but because the body as a unity cannot be separated from the head The Church as the Body of Christ has continued over these two millennia to make Christ present to the world And we as members of that same body through the Church must continue this mission Like the disciples in our Gospel today Luke 244653 we must continually praise God with great joy and bring into the world the love of Christ that we ourselves experience Next weekend we will celebrate the Feast of Pentecost To reiterate what I said above our diocese has a wonderful problem in that we have many young men discerning Gods call to the priesthood for our diocese This problem does however come at a significant financial cost for the diocese Seminary often lasts 68 years and includes a variety of studies pastoral work and discernment to ade quately prepare our young priests to minister within our diocese To assist in this burden of seminarian education we will join every parish in the diocese to take up a special second collection next weekend for the Seminarian Education Fund On behalf of our seminarians and future priests thank you for your generosity Given our weekly parish prayer for vocations with its special focus on religious and priestly vocations this fund may one day please God assist a seminarian and future priest from within our own parish family As we celebrate the Feast of Pentecost we will also celebrate our six high school graduates with our annual Baccalaureate Mass Congratulations to our graduates and may God bless you on the next step of your journey Faithfully in Christ Fr David PENTECOST COLLECTION FOR SEMINARIAN EDUCA TION Next weekend is the Pentecost
