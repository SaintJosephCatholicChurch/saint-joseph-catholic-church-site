  "text": "Eleventh Sunday in Ordinary Time June 18 2023 Happy Father's Day to all those in our parish who are fathers grandfathers godfathers uncles and all who provide a father's care to others in so many ways By living out your vocation of fatherhood you help to help reveal to us glimpses of the very fatherhood of God Thank you for living out your vocation Know of our love and gratitude for you May St Joseph foster father of Jesus intercede for you before the throne of God This weekend June 17th 18th the Church celebrates the Eleventh Sunday in Ordinary Time Following Pentecost and the Solemnities of the Holy Trinity and the Holy Eucharist we return at last to a green Sunday after over sixteen weeks Save for a few other solemnities and feast days we will now spend the remainder of the liturgical year twenty four weeks in Ordinary Time Though called ordinary this time is anything but The term ordinary itself comes from the Latin ordinalis meaning numbered or ordered and simply reflects that these weekends are numbered It does not mean that this period of time is devoid of its own special mysteries Instead that which we experienced throughout the first half of the liturgical year will now be unpacked over the many coming weeks This unpacking is done through our readings from the Sacred Scriptures The focus of these readings through Ordinary Time is on the moral life and the teachings of the Lord As we spent the first half of the liturgical year walking alongside the life of Christ we now focus on how to walk the life of Christ in our own lives We are called to put into action all that has been revealed to us up to this point National Eucharistic Revival The Parish Year Thank you to all those who joined in our Eucharistic Procession for Corpus Christi Sunday last weekend We joined with parishes throughout the diocese hosting processions to inaugurate the Parish Year of the National Eucharistic Revival Among events this coming year we will host a Forty Hours Devotion in November and a procession that extends beyond our parish campus and into our parish community next Corpus Christi Sunday May 29 2024 Did You Know The Sacrament of Baptism Baptism is our entry into the Body of Christ which is the Church Through this Sacrament we are cleansed of Original Sin and any personal sin up to that very moment and receive sanctifying grace Sanctifying grace is that free gift which restores that which was lost in the fall of our first parents our relationship with God Through baptism we are born into supernatural life John 31 21 and become Children of God and as such heirs of heaven Baptism is administered through the three fold pouring of water on the head of the person to be baptized as the Trinitarian formula is recited I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit The outward sign of the pouring of or immersion into water is a sign of washing or cleansing and signifies the washing away of Original Sin that occurs through the action The person to be baptized is an individual of any age If they are beyond the age of reason the person will present themselves to be baptized once they have been prepared in the Faith If below the age of reason those to whom their care is entrusted parentsguardians will bring them forth In the latter situation those presenting a child for baptism make a promise and commitment on behalf of the child to raise them in the Faith so that they might live that supernatural life into which they have now been born Jesus not only institutes this Sacrament as He commands His Disciples Matthew 2819 20 to baptize and gives them the form to be used but He also declares explicitly the necessity of baptism John 3 In this necessary Sacrament we are given sanctifying grace become members of the Church and are able to receive the other Sacraments In addition to the Sacrament of Baptism itself the Church also recognizes baptism by blood martyrdom and desire for those who could not through no fault of their own approach the Sacrament of Baptism Saturday June 17 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am Confession 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Ed Bushee Sunday
