Kelsey Peters Tom Richhart and Carol Lochtefeld SECOND SUNDAY OF EASTER APRIL 8 2018 Yr MERCY SUNDAY Mercy and Love in Fellowship of Christ inevitable for salvation My dear brothers and sisters in Christ the Lord be with you Today is Mercy Sunday Pope St John Paul II recommended today as the Mercy Sunday following the instruc tion given by Our Lord Jesus Christ through St Faustina Next year we shall try to do some Novena before the Mercy Sunday Here in St Josephs Church the bells ring at 3:00pm every day That is an indication of something What is it What happens at 3:00pm every day The bells are calling you to come here and pray the Divine Mercy Rosary Think seriously about this and let me know what you suggest So the ball is in your court About this weekend reading readings I want to remind you that the Parish is the True center of Christian Spiritual Fellowship for our community In the First Reading Acts 43235 The disciples gathered together as a community of believers praying and caring for one another They enjoyed the company of one another breaking bread that is the Eucharist in their homes In their midst Christian love is put into practice as we read in the second reading 1 Jn 516 In the Gospel Jn 201931 The baby Christian Church protected herself in closed doors for the fear of Jews and the risen Lord appeared to them and said Peace be with you It is this peace of Christ which satisfies every desire the Church wishes us This kind of peace the world cannot give This kind of peace is experienced in love in caring for one another in forgiveness and in trust and in having mercy For those who love God everything works onto good Thomas one of the apostles was not there when the Lord appeared When the other apostles told him we have seen the Lord he refused to believe And when next the Lord appeared he was there and in his amaze ment when he saw the Lord he exclaimed My Lord and My God His absence when the Lord appeared to all of them the first time brought us blessings because the Lord Jesus said Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed We are those who did not see and we are blessed if we believe So let us believe My I use this opportunity to thank you all for your wonderful efforts during Lent respectable number of you kept the spirit of Lent volunteered attended daily Masses came for Stations of the Cross went to Confession especially on March 18 2015 came for 5 days Mission Week and the Celebration of our Parish 140 Years etc I am very happy Please keep these efforts up Do not abandon them for they help us to

seat Did you know The residual effects of having been abused can last a lifetime Those who have been abused seldom just get over it The sense of violation goes deeper into a persons psyche and feelings of anger shame hurt and betrayal can build long after the abuse has taken place Some have even described the feeling as if it has scarred their soul Those who have been abused can heal but it often takes time therapy and the support of loved ones As a Church we can help support those who have been abused by keeping them in prayer and providing opportunities for healing VOLUNTEERS MARK YOUR
