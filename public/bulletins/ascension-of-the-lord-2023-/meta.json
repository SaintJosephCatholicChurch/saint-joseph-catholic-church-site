  "text": "The Ascension of the Lord May 21 2023 This weekend May 20th 21st the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord Marking forty days after Easter Sunday the Ascension of the Lord actually fell this past Thursday In our diocese however this celebration is transferred to the nearest weekend to better allow all the Faithful to join in its celebration This desire for all to join in its celebration should serve as an emphasis of how truly important this solemnity is in the life of the Church In the Ascension of the Lord Heaven has caught up the joy of earth Angelic Choirs are preparing to receive their promised Lord standing at the Gates that they may open them upon the mighty Conqueror's approach Those holy souls that were liberated from death's domain on the morning of the Resurrection are waiting for the happy moment when Heaven's gate closed by Adam's sin will be thrown open They will rejoice as they enter Heaven with their Redeemer Before ascending our Risen Jesus visits His Apostles and bids them farewell They do not however allow His Ascension to sadden them instead returning to Jerusalem with great joy Luke 2452 The Mysteries of our Redemption have been brought to completion This is a day meant for joy and triumph St Francis Summer Reading Program Next weekend we will begin sign ups for our St Francis Summer Reading Program This program running June through July is meant to encourage our young parishioners to continue their religious formation throughout the summer by reading various faith filled books The book cart will be available in the Narthex starting in June and books can be checked out throughout the summer Participating youth will be able to claim prizes from the Prize Box throughout the summer At the end of the summer the top readers in our various grade levels will be awarded special prizes including Chamber Bucks for their hard work If you are willing to help hand out prizes from the Prize Box after Masses each weekend please see the sign up sheet in the Narthex this and next weekend Pentecost Collection for Seminarian Education Next weekend as the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Pentecost we have a special collection for the diocesan wide Pentecost Collection for Seminarian Education This collection helps to support the education and training of our future priests This year two men are being ordained to the transitional diaconate and seven to the priesthood for our diocese Every parish household will be receiving a letter from our diocesan Vocation Director encouraging your support of this collection and explaining the ways to donate To make a donation through the parish please place the specially marked Pentecost Collection envelope from your envelope packets in the collection basket next weekend or donate to this fund through our online giving options Mark Your Calendars Corpus Christi Procession On Sunday June 11th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Corpus Christi This will also mark the end of the Diocesan Year for the National Eucharistic Revival and the beginning of the Parish Year Following our 10 AM Mass on Sunday June 11th we will hold a Corpus Christi Procession on our parish campus You are invited to join us in procession as a reminder that we are a pilgrim people journeying through this earthly existence following after Jesus In a Eucharistic Procession we follow after the Lord physically even as we pledge anew to do so spiritually We also give public witness to our acceptance of the Lord's words The bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world John 651 It is my hope that next year on the Solemnity of Corpus Christi we will have our first ever Eucharistic Procession that goes beyond our parish campus and out into our local community as we transition from the Parish Year to the National Year of the Eucharistic Revival Note Next weekend our nation observes Memorial Day as we honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of
