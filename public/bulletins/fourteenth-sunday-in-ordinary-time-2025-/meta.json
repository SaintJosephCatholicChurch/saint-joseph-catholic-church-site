July Holiday whether you are with us while visiting family or camping at the State Park May you have a blessed and relaxing holiday and know that you are always welcome at St Joseph's This weekend July 5th 6th the Church celebrates the Fourteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time It is the first Sunday since the beginning of March that we are now back to wearing the green of Ordinary Time We will remain in this season throughout the next five months until the liturgical year ends with the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe and a new year in God's grace begins with the start of Advent Our journey through the remaining twenty Sundays of Ordinary Time will unfold with a steady rhythm broken only by two meaningful interludes On September 14th we will celebrate the Solemnity of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross and on November 2nd the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed Though these days may seem distinct they draw us to a singular truth The hope we share in Christ's triumph over death The flow of the liturgical year is meant to remind us that the Church is alive The liturgical year like our life is a journey It walks with us through every season of life For this reason the year shifts in color tone and rhythm From Advent's preparation to Christmas joy from Lent's sorrow to Easter triumph Even in the quiet of Ordinary Time as we are learning how to live The Church is big enough for all of it for all of life in Christ for our life As we enter back into Ordinary Time we continue our journey through the St Luke's Gospel We are now picking up in the tenth chapter of the Gospel placing us at Jesus final journey His fateful death march toward Jerusalem that formally began in Luke 951 Yet despite the foreshadowing of His coming suffering and death that immediately preceded our Gospel reading this Sunday finds us temporarily caught up in the joy of Jesus ministry In sending out and receiving back His disciples Jesus forms around Himself a spiritual Jerusalem a community called to embody peace and restoration Through their healing ministry they fulfill the ancient prophecies of the Lord's holy city Though often overshadowed by the Twelve the seventy two disciples played a vital role in God's plan anticipating the Church's wider mission of service spiritual authority and radical trust in divine providence St Joe Cooks 150th Anniversary
