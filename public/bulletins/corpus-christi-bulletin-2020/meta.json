  "text": "CORPUS CHRISTI SUNDAY June 14 2020 This weekend June 13th14th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Jesus Christ also known as the Feast of Corpus Christi On this day we celebrate the great gift of the Most Holy Eucharist In this gift we find Jesus Christ Himself We hold true to the words of our Savior that we hear in the sixth chapter of St Johns Gospel this weekend My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him Historically this feast day is rooted in a miracle from the mid13th Century In 1263 a German priest was on pilgrimage in Italy as he of fered the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass at the Basilica of St Christina in Bol sena During the Consecration the priest who had been having internal doubts about the Real Presence of our Lord in the Eucharist lifted the Eucharist and saw that the Host was bleeding The priest upon seeing the bleeding host immediately took our Eucharistic Lord with him to the nearby city of Orvieto where Pope Ur ban IV was visiting Declared as a miracle the corporal the linen cloth placed on the altar and the bleeding Host are still displayed at the church in Orvieto for veneration and adoration of our Lord The follow ing year 1264 Urban IV declared the Feast of Corpus Christi to serve as a joyous celebration of the Eucharist in the liturgical calendar I invite and encourage all of us to deepen our faith in the Real Pres ence of Jesus in the Most Holy Eucharist and to truly place Him at the center of our spiritual lives How can we do this practically in our daily lives Attend daily Mass Participate in Eucharistic Adoration throughout the week Visit the Church and spend time in front of our Lord in prayer Make use of the Sacrament of Confession to be best disposed when re ceiving Holy Communion Read the Bread of Life Discourse John 6 As Ive mentioned several times my summer classes began at the beginning of the month Many have asked a simple question What classes are you taking For June I am taking two courses Consecrated Life and American Law for Canonists In Consecrated Life we are learn ing about consecrated life nuns monks sisters brothers etc within the Church In American Law for Canonists we are presented with a brief overview of the American legal system and how it relates to the Churchs Code of Canon Law As of this weekend I will have completed the course on Consecrated Life and for the next two weeks will be focused on the American Law course Each day has consisted of 45 hours of lectures daily course readings in class discussions and over each two week course sev eral assignments and examinations At the end of the month I will then begin the July Semester which will offer two courses on Lay Ministry and Procedural Law For the next two weeks I will be in class for live discussions for most of the morning and early afternoon Thankfully with Fr Felicichias help we will not need to change our weekday Mass schedule for this coming week Our times will remain at 11:30AM on Tuesday Thursday Saturday and 7:00PM on Wednesday The following week as Fr Fe licichia begins his first priestly assignment as Associate Pastor of St Elizabeth Ann Seton in Fort Wayne we will most likely need to move to a later Mass time for weekday Mass due to my class schedule I do not yet know my July class times or formats so our weekday schedule for July remains up in the air I will share more information as I receive it Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday June 13 11:30am No Mass
