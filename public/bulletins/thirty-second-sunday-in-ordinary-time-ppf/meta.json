  "text": "HIRTY ECOND UNDAY I RDINARY IME OVEMBER 7 2021 This week November 6th 7th the Church celebrates the Thirtysecond Sunday in Ordinary Time Following the excitement of last week with our various celebrations we will now focus entirely on the end of the liturgical year and our preparations for the coming Advent season The celebration of the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe will conclude this year of grace and enter us anew into our yearly preparations to rejoice in the joy of the Incarnation As it is a seemingly short season we do not want to enter into Advent unprepared Instead just as we put time and effort into preparing for the holiday of Christmas so must we prepare for the holy day of Christmas We are not simply preparing our hearths and homes for family and friends but our hearts for Jesus Christ May we use these next three weeks to discern how we will best approach the coming Advent season to prepare for the joy of Christmas Day LL AINTS AY AND LL OULS AY ECAP Thank you to everyone who made our All Saints Day and All Souls Day celebrations a success special Thank You to Lauren Andrews for preparing our All Saints Day games to Michelle Paxton and Dianna Cole for organizing our potluck and to Dan Geimer for serving as Master of Ceremonies at our cemetery blessing Congratulations to our All Saints Day Costume Contest Winner St Rose of Lima Ainsley It was great to come together over these days as a community and share the joy that comes from living our faith in Christ Our bulletin cover captures but a few moments of prayer fraternity and joy that was shared this past Monday and Tuesday Though our direct celebrations have ended may we remember that the entire month of November is dedicated to prayer for the Poor Souls in Purgatory During this month we remember our dearly departed loved ones who have gone before us and dedicate ourselves to prayer and works of penance for them plenary indulgence can be gained under the usual conditions prayer for the intentions of the Holy Father sacramental communion and confession and a total detachment from sin by visiting a cemetery to pray for the faithful departed on any and every day throughout the month of November I encourage and hope that you will take advantage of this opportunity for prayer on behalf of the Holy Souls ETERANS AY AND ARTIN OF OURS On Thursday November 11th we as a nation celebrate Veterans Day and as a Church celebrate the Memorial of St Martin of Tours Veterans Day initially known as Armistice Day originally marked the formal end of the First World War on November 11 1918 Over time it came to serve as we know it today as a day to honor thank and pray for all of our veterans Quite providentially the Memorial of St Martin of Tours falls on this day as well Living in the early4th Century St Martin was conscripted into the Roman army After a dream where he gave a poor beggar who was Jesus Christ a portion of his cloak St Martin accepted Christianity and was baptized Once released from his service to the army he served the Church in many ways Being sent out as a missionary founding a monastery and becoming the Bishop of Tours in modernday France May we thank our veterans this Veterans Day and ask the Lord through the intercession of St Martin to watch over them always Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday November 6 8:00am
