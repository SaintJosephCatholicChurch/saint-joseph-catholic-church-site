2024 Welcome Home to all of our college students home for the summer break This weekend May 18th 19th the Church celebrates Pentecost Sunday Marking fifty days since Easter Sunday this celebration brings an end to Eastertide For this reason our Paschal Candle is processed out after our last Sunday Mass and placed next to the baptismal font emphasizing our transition from Eastertide to Ordinary Time It is also a sign that we like the Apostles today must carry the good news of the Risen Christ out into the world This solemnity is often referred to as the birthday of the Church for this very reason As the Apostles filled with the Holy Spirit leave the locked room the mission of the Church begins Truly the Holy Spirit enlivens and gives life to the Church Or in the words of St Augustine of Hippo What our soul is to our own members this the Holy Spirit is to the members of Christ to the Body of Christ which is the Church St Augustine continues emphasizing how the Lord commends to the Apostles the unity of the Church at Pentecost He commended the Church to them again The Bridegroom entrusted His Bride to the care of His friends not that she should love one among them but that She might love Him as Her Spouse and them as friends of the Bridegroom This emphasizes another term often given to the Church The Bride of Christ cf Ephesians 522 33 As detailed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church Para 796 The unity of Christ and the Church head and members of one Body also implies the distinction of the two within a personal relationship This aspect is often expressed by the image of bridegroom and bride a theme prepared for by the prophets announced by John the Baptist and referenced by the Lord Himself St Paul speaks of the whole Church and of each of the faithful members of his Body as a bride betrothed to Christ the Lord so as to become but one spirit with him The Church is the spotless bride of the spotless Lamb Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her He has joined her with himself in an everlasting covenant and never stops caring for her as for his own body Pentecost Seminarian Collection On Saturday our diocese celebrated the ordination of Andrew Barnes to the Order of the Diaconate Dcn Andy will be joined by his classmate Nicholas Monin in ordination this coming October On June 1st we will also rejoice in the ordination of two men Dcn Oscar Duarte and Dcn Caleb Kruse to the Priesthood of Jesus Christ In these ordinations we see the mission of the Church begun on Pentecost continuing even to this day These young men have spent the past several years prayerfully discerning and preparing for their ordination day Their spiritual intellectual and human formation is entrusted during this time to the seminaries that they attend This formation is made possible and affordable for these young men thanks to our annual Pentecost Seminarian Collection Thank you for your generosity to this annual collection aiding the formation of our future priests Universal Jubilee Year and Parish Sesquicentennial Earlier this month our Holy Father Pope Francis announced that this coming year will be marked as a Jubilee Year or a Holy Year in the Church This celebration commonly occuring every twenty five years for the last seven centuries has been given the theme Pilgrims of Hope This year will have a special emphasis on increasing and repairing our relationship with God and with one another In addition to this universal celebration our parish will be celebrating its 150th Anniversary Formally erected as a parish in 1875 by Bishop Dwenger St Joseph has been serving our community for 150 years It is my hope that we greet this celebration with great joy and as we look back and cherish the past 150 years we also look ahead to the next 150 years The mission of the Church begun on Pentecost continues even today right here at St Joseph's PARISH CALENDAR Sat May 18 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass
