Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time Jer 145 1719 1 Cor 12311313 or 13413 Lk 42130 Scriptural Reflection for the 3rd Sunday in Ordinary Time After much suffering Israel has at last returned to the promised land in our first reading Nehemiah 826 810 Though their freedom from Babylon was long awaited Israel found itself returning to a land ravaged and destroyed nearly a century and a half after King Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem Though they began to restore Jerusa lem under the guidance of Nehemiah and Ezra the destruction around them would have seemed so overwhelming Under the order of Nebuchadnezzar the Temple had been destroyed the city razed and the Davidic line seemingly destroyed Even though they had begun to rebuild the city walls the few who had returned with Nehemiah fell to grumbling and complaining And yet the walls were eventually restored and many oth ers returned from Babylon to join Nehemiah and Israel to resettle the promised land To best understand what they were undertaking in their return to Jerusalem Ezra as the priest gathers those returning from captivity and reads aloud to them from the book of the law Though Israels infidelity led to their exile and the ruins of their city served as a constant reminder of their sin God still remains faithful to His covenant He will not allow His chosen people to perish Israel in turn renews their covenant as they prostrate themselves before the Lord Recognizing how they had gone so far astray from the Lord the people begin to mourn and lament for their past sinfulness Nehemiah and Ezra call the people back from mourning and weeping and extol them to rejoice While Israel had strayed from the Lord He now calls them back to Himself as they return to the promised land Israel is to always find their true strength in God Himself As Israel experienced such great emotions through the recitation of the book of the law in our first reading they do so again in our Gospel Luke 114 41421 When Jesus returns to Nazareth He enters the synagogue and reads from the prophet Isaiah as the people gaze on Him intently News of the beginning of Jesus coming out of the de sert quickly spread throughout the whole region as He comes to the town of His youth Though they knew Him something was different at this moment as He read from the scroll His words at the conclusion of this Gospel signifies the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy from which He had just read in Him Questions would have con tinued to arise within the hearts of those gathered if Jesus of Nazareth could truly be the Christ the longawaited Messiah Like the Israelites with Ezra and Nehemiah those with Jesus in the synagogue are greatly affected by hearing from the Word of God As our psalm response says to day the words of the Lord are Spirit and life Gods Word is alive Just as it affected those in our readings today it must also affect us The reading of and mediation on the Scriptures should be a part of our daily lives The Word of God will speak to us in ways that we may have never expected But it cannot do so if we are not willing to make it a part of our lives I would encourage each of us to set some time apart each and every day to read from the Sacred Scriptures Whether it be meditating upon the daily Mass read ings or reflecting on a specific book of the Sacred Scriptures allow the Word of God to be a familiar part of our day If we are willing to do so we will see how it changes our lives What is Father Wearing Liturgical Vestments As mentioned last week we will dedicate a portion of our homily each week end to walk through the different parts of the Mass Having heard of how the Mass is the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the Cross we are now prepared to look at the preparation for this sacrifice From the first moment we walk into the Church whether we realize it or not our minds and hearts are being drawn from the worldly to the heavenly We begin our prayer even before the Mass itself has begun The insert to this bulletin provides a look at the various vestments that the priest wears to offer Mass as well as their meaning and the prayers the priest prays when vest ing for Mass Similar to the practice of the Levitical priesthood described in Exodus 28 Christian liturgical vestments serve as a special kind of clothing to be used exclu sively in the performance of liturgical rites They serve as a uniform of the priests sacred office and when vested signify that we are breaking from the worldly as we are approaching the heavenly realities revealed to us in the liturgical rites of the Church Christian liturgical vestments themselves arose from the secular dress of the faithful in the early Church Vestments as we see today most accurately reflect the dress of Greek and Roman cultures in the 4th Century following the legalization of Christian ity by the Emperor Constantine The color of the vestments reflect the color associated with each liturgical season Purple represents Penance and Preparation and is used dur ing Advent and Lent Red represents Sacrifice and is primarily used during Pentecost and the feast day of Martyrs Rose represents Anticipation and is used on the third Sunday of Advent and the fourth Sunday of Lent Green represents Hope and Life and is used during Ordinary Time WhiteGold represents Joy and Purity and is used during Easter and Christmas and the feast day of the Saints who werent martyred WEEKEND OF February 23 2019 CANTORS 500 Jay Crisp Choir Mass 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Nichole Decker LECTORS 500 Knights of Columbus
