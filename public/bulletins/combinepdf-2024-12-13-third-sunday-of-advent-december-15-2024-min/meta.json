105 10 Lk 139 45 Third Sunday of Advent December 15 2024 This weekend December 14th 15th the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Advent also known as Gaudete Sunday This name comes from the Latin gaudete or rejoice which is the beginning of the Introit for this Mass The reading from which the Introit is taken Philippians 44 will be heard in full as our second reading this lectionary cycle Each of our readings this weekend are suffused with expressions of joy and jubilation Gaudete Sunday marks the liturgical halfway point of Advent and the Church rejoices because Jesuss coming is near This expectant joy is reflected in the rose colored vestments worn by the priest and the third Advent candle both of which mix the penitential violet of Advent with the joyful gold of Christmastide Though we return to our more austere practices tomorrow let us rejoice today knowing that the Lord is near This coming Tuesday December 17th the Church will fully change her focus from the coming of Christ at the end of time to His coming on Christmas Day On Tuesday we will begin the recitation of the Antiphons included on this weekend's cover every night during Vespers or Evening Prayer Dating back to at least the 6th Century each antiphon is an Old Testament messianic prophecy that has been fulfilled in Jesus Christ By the 8th Century the Antiphons were in regular use in Rome In the view of some historians of liturgical music it was Benedictine monks who first arranged these antiphons with a definite purpose and order Working in reverse order the first letter of each antiphon spells out Latin for Tomorrow I come to you As the Antiphons end on Christmas Eve this phrase anticipates the coming joy of the Christ child on Christmas Day In our modern day these antiphons are perhaps most recognizable from the lyrics of Come Come Emmanuel The repeated use of Come crescendo ing with each verse is meant to emphasize our intense longing and desire for Jesus Christ In the same way these four weeks of Advent are meant to awaken us from slumber stoke the flames of our hearts and prepare us to welcome the Christ child on Christmas Day Update on Parish Renovations Part II Earlier this year I was able to share how we are starting to move forward in preparing plans for our parish renovation As previously mentioned we are working together with Bill Heyer of William Heyer Architecture out of Bexley Ohio As of this past week after consulting with our Parish Council at our December meeting we have approved the scope of work for the project Following the approved scope of work Bill and his team are preparing conceptual designs that we will be able to share with the parish in the coming months The main scope of work remains focused on updating our flooring to replace the heavily worn carpet in the sanctuary and nave fresh paint and stenciling in the sanctuary and nave and increasing our seating capacity in the nave to better accommodate the size of our growing parish family In addition to these needed updates we are also looking at how to better highlight and add increased devotional space in the Church This includes highlighting the location of our current statuary St Joseph the Blessed Virgin Mary the Sacred Heart of Jesus the Infant of Prague and St Thrse of Lisieux and how we can include additional statuary into our Church It is my hope that we will be able to add a statue or painting of Bl Solanus Casey who served in nearby Huntington into the Church as a part of this renovation Along with the original blueprints from the church we have also shared a number of historical pictures and details with Bill and his team As we enter into our 150th Parish Anniversary this renovation will also be an opportunity to help incorporate various elements of our parish's history into the Church design and decoration What a beautiful way to celebrate such a momentous time in the life of parish uniting our past with our present as we look towards the bright future that lies ahead in Jesus Christ Faithfully in Christ Fr David ORG Our Parish Code 7N68MY Weekend of December 21st 22nd 500 Dan Lautzenheiser 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 David Smith 500 Stacey
