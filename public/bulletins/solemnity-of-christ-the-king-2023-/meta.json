all who will be traveling home We hope you had a joyful visit and thank you for joining us in this Sacrifice of Thanksgiving the Holy Mass This weekend November 25th 26th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe Though this title has biblical roots cf Isaiah 96 7 Revelations 1913 16 the celebration itself is a more recent addition to our liturgical calendar Following the great horrors seen by the world after the First World War Pope Pius XI instituted this feast day in 1926 for the last Sunday in October Pius XI correctly predicted that the attempt to thrust Jesus Christ and His holy law out of public life would only result in continuing discord among people and nations As such he desired that this solemnity would hasten the return of society to our loving Savior and to win over to the Lord those hearts that are bitter and estranged from Him In this way the King of Peace Himself can rule over and in every human heart In 1969 Pope St Paul VI in a desire to enhance the witness of this feast day moved it to the last Sunday in the liturgical year and upgraded it from a feast day to a solemnity the highest rank of a celebration in the liturgical calendar By moving this day to the last Sunday in the liturgical year Paul VI emphasized this celebration's connection of Christ's kingship with His second advent or coming to judge the world which is emphasized throughout the first half of Advent Today we see very clearly how peace still eludes us in the world We only have to turn on any news station to see how social political and economic orders are often shaken Nations throughout the world continue in many ways to reject the light of the Gospel In this annual celebration we recognize how the world needs now more than ever our witness to Christ's kingship With Christ as King of our hearts we can help to bring healing to a broken world Forty Hours Devotion This coming Monday Nov27 th we will begin our Forty Hours Devotion with an opening Mass at 7 PM Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament will begin immediately following Mass and will continue throughout the next two days On Tuesday Nov 28th we will have our daily Mass at

praying sung Vespers at 6:30PM in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament Following sung Vespers there will be a conference on Tuesday at 7 PM offered by our eucharistic speaker Fr Daniel Steiner Finally we will conclude our Forty Hours with a closing Mass on Wednesday Nov 29th at 7 PM I encourage and invite you to come and spend time with our Eucharistic Lord throughout this devotion The time spots that we filled are only meant to ensure that our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament is never left unadorned This means that you are welcome to come and spend any amount of time at any time of da with
