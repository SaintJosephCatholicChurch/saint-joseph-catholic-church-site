  "text": "The Most Holy Trinity Sunday June 4 2023 This weekend June 3rd 4th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity With the end of the Easter season on Pentecost Sunday we now enter into Ordinary Time for the remainder of the Church year Though this may seem a minor detail it is worth remembering that this season will continue for nearly half a calendar year before we finally enter into a new liturgical year with the start of Advent at the beginning of December Over this past year from the beginning of Advent all the way to Pentecost we have witnessed the entire series of the Mysteries of our Redemption These seasons have entered us fully into the divine drama that is salvation history itself Given this what then can possibly await us over the next six months of Ordinary Time As today's solemnity highlights we move from hearing of salvation history itself to learning how we ourselves each and every one of us are invited to be a part of salvation history Corpus Christi Procession Join us next Sunday after the 10 AM Mass for our Corpus Christi Procession This procession though short will take us along the outer edge of our campus parking lot before returning to the Church for Benediction The procession itself should take 15 20 minutes and will begin at approximately 11:20AM In addition to the procession the 10 AM Mass next Sunday will also be our Graduation Mass where our high school graduates will be honored for their achievements Joining these two events together the graduation Mass and the Eucharistic Procession will serve as a reminder to our graduates and to each of us that as we are sent forth into the world we are always led by Jesus Christ Priesthood Ordinations On Saturday Bishop Rhoades ordained seven men to the Priesthood for our diocese Fr Samuel Anderson Fr Brian Florin Fr Robert Krisch Fr Zane Langenbrunner Fr David Langford Fr Jacob Schneider and Fr Ryan Timossi Five of the seven will be assigned as parochial vicars at parishes throughout the diocese while the other two Fr Anderson and Fr Langenbrunner will return to Rome to complete their academic studies this coming year before being assigned to parish ministry next year On behalf of our newly ordained thank you for your generosity to the annual Pentecost Collection in support of our seminarians and their formation May we continue to pray for vocations from within our diocese and our own parish Did You Know The Sacraments With the return of our Did You Know Campaign our focus will be on the Sacraments Throughout the centuries the Church has held to the belief of the seven Sacraments Baptism Confirmation the Eucharist Confession Anointing of the Sick Holy Orders and Matrimony Each Sacrament is spoken of in Church Tradition and has a firm foundation in the Sacred Scriptures Given the most basic definition a Sacrament is an outward sign instituted by Christ to give grace An outward sign is a visible sign reflecting a spiritual reality Using Baptism as our example the pouring of water in Baptism signifies the washing away of Original Sin It is not however a mere sign The inward grace of Baptism remission of Original Sin is given through the outward act the pouring of water with the Trinitarian formula Emphasizing that we are both body and soul this outward sign truly gives grace In Baptism we are given sanctifying grace which is a sharing in the life of God Himself Just as this grace was lost to man by Original Sin the Sacrament of Baptism restores this grace through Jesus Christ The other Sacraments also either give sanctifying grace or strengthen the grace that is already present in us As Jesus is the source of all grace the Sacraments are themselves instituted by Christ He alone determines the manner in which His grace is distributed Therefore His Church distributes His grace through the Sacraments in the same way that He instituted them eg Baptism is instituted in Matthew 2819 MASS INTENTIONS Saturday
