Obliga tion celebrating the Solemnity of All Saints On this day we rejoice with the Church Triumphant Those men and women who have lived lives in imitation of our Lord Jesus Christ and are now united with Him in Heaven for all eter nity The love of God is so strong that even death itself cannot separate us from Jesus Christ Romans 83839 This also means that even death cannot separate us from our brothers and sisters in the Lord as we are all members of His Body which is the Church The Saints have become that great cloud of witnesses Hebrews 121 that we join with through the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass in worship of God Through their witness they point us to Jesus through their intercession they aide us in growing in our relationship with Him To celebrate the Solemnity of All Saints we will offer a vigil Mass on Thursday Oct 31st at 7 PM and Masses on Friday Nov 1st at both 7 AM and 5:30PM incense may be used at this Mass Following our 5:30PM Mass on Friday Nov 1st all are invited to

they prepare for complete enjoyment of life with God in Christ Purgatory a state of postmortem purification exists and it is of benefit to those souls who are experiencing purification that we remember them in prayer 2 Maccabees 123946 particularly at the Sacrifice of the Holy Mass To put it another way just as we can pray for someones struggles in this life we can surely do the same for them after death as we remain con nected to one another through Jesus Christ For the Commemoration of All Souls Day we will offer Masses on Saturday Nov 2nd at 8 AM and Noon Note The Noon Mass will be
