HUMBLED SO HUMBLE YOURSELF TO BE EXALTED My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all PRAY FOR OUR PRIESTS AND BISHOPS Todays Bible readings have some unkind words for our Priests and Bishops These words were addressed to the Priests of both old and new dispensation We the Priests of the new dispensation must heed to these words They are very important and Iwe should heed them I need your help in my ministry We Priests and Bishops need your cooperation We need your support we need your prayers Listen to these frightening words in the 1st Reading Mal 114b22b And now priests this commandment is for you If you do not lay it to heart to give glory to my name I will send curse upon you And He went on and on and on Wow It is frightening We need your prayer The consoling idea is that the Lord God says If So I need to do my best though my best is not THE BEST But I must strive So please pray for priests so that we will be up and doing I am consoled by the Respon sorial Psalm In you Lord I have found my peace So we need to fly to God Fly to His protection and we shall be protected In the 2nd Reading 1 Thes 27b9 13 We Priests and Bishops are again chal lenged by St Paul when he said We were gentle among you as nursing mother cares for her children We should be so to each of Though todays 1st Reading and the Gos pel were critical of Priests and Bishops you Christians must pray for us Look at us with the eyes of faith Not every Priest or Bishop are as gentle great saintly and dedi cated as Paul was I am not defending or holding brief for any Priest or Bishop but the Christians should receive the PriestsBishops and their work HomiliesSermons minis try as word and message not as those of human but as it truly is the word of God which is now at work in you who believe cf 1 Thes 213 In the Gospel Mt 23112 Matthew the Evangelist in 70 AD defending the faith of the Church he was pastoring was involved in a bitter hostility between the Christians and Judaism after the destruction of Jerusalem It was quibbles between Christians and Jewish Rabbis You see this showed the human face and factor at work in the early Church Priests Should heed the lesson Thus the Lord Jesus admonished us when He said us the Priests and the Faithful The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their seats on the Chair of Moses Therefore do and observe all things whatever they tell you but do not follow their example For they preach but do not practice The greatest among you must be your servant Whoever exalts himself will be humbled but whoever humbles himself will be exalted This a very important call for caution for Priests Bishops and all of us Be humble Be considerate Do not be fast to judge and condemn Rather be slow to judge bear with one another Be gentle and loving And above all try to forgive God blesses Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 Remember to write in the journal provided at the Narthex the names of your loved ones who passed and you want them to be remembered and prayed for in a distinct way all through the month of November if you have not done so 2 We plan for Pilgrimage to the Holy Land to join in the Foot Steps of Jesus

hope of the resurrection They need our prayers our love and our help One of the best ways in fact the best way to show love and help them is by booking Masses for them Do not forget your loved ones who have passed away so that you will be remembered and prayed for when your own time comes May you kindly then write the names of those you love to pray for in the sheets of paper in the folder
