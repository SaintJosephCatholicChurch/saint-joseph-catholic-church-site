  "text": "Second Sunday of Lent March 8 2020 This weekend the Church enters into the 2nd Sunday of Lent In our readings we hear of the Transfiguration Our Lord ascends Mt Tabor with Peter James and John and as they approach the mountain top He becomes dazzling white and is found speaking with Moses the giver of the Law and Elijah the greatest of the prophets As quickly as they ascend however the moment ends and they must come down from the mountain top Our Lord gives His Apostles this brief respite on their way to Jerusalem and to the Cross to help steadfast them for what is to come Just as our Lord shows this moment to His Apostles so often does He do the same for us with mountain top experiences These can be tremendous moments such as the birth of a child or a major promotion to smaller moments such as doing well on an assignment or simply having a good day In all of these moments of great joy we feel that God is right with us But as with any mountain top experience they end much too quickly and our journey just like our Lords journey continues We are given these moments of joy to serve as a reminder of the eternal joy that we are striving for in the heavenly kingdom One such moment that we can enter into so often is found in the Sacrament of Reconciliation In making a good confession we experience the mercy of God and are given grace to steadfast ourselves as we continue on this earthly journey Things have bound us are loosed sins are forgiven and healing is ushering into our lives In addition to our 3 weekly hours of Confession and our coming Penance Service we will join with all other parishes in our Diocese this week for the annual The Light is On for You Campaign Every parish in our diocese will offer the Sacrament of Confession this Tuesday March 10th from 600 8:00PM No matter how long it has been I encourage you to make use of the Sacrament this Lenten season Climb up the mountain with our Lord and experience His glory in this Sacrament Novena and the Solemnity of St Joseph This Tuesday March 10th will also begin our St Joseph Novena These nine days of prayer will lead us into our celebration of St Josephs Day Please see the insert in this weeks bulletin both for an explanation of what a novena is as well as the prayers for the St Joseph Novena I encourage you to pray for a specific intention and follow along in this Novena prayer at home Or if you would prefer to pray together as a community we will be praying these prayers after our daily Masses throughout the week Then join us for our special evening Mass on St Josephs Day on Thursday March 19th at 7 PM followed by ice cream in the Social Hall Our Neighbors to the NorthSt Aloysius few weeks ago I met with Msgr Bruce Piechocki pastor of St Aloysius in Yoder As neighboring parishes Msgr Bruce and I would like to increase the opportunities for interactions between our two parish families both spiritually and fraternally Being so close to one another it is a wonderful opportunity to see the great breadth of our own local Catholic community As such we will be inviting each others parish to our own parish missions happening on separate weeks Please see the flyer in
