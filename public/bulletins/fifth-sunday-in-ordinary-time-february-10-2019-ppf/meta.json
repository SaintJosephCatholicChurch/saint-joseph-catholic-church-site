1758 1 Cor 15121620 Lk 6172026 FIFTH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME FEBRUARY 10 2019 In our first reading Isaiah 618 we hear the call of the prophet Isaiah The Lord calls to Isaiah during the middle of the 8th Century BC following the death of King Uzziah Isaiah relates that his call comes during a Temple liturgy as he is surrounded by Sera phim angels of the Lord that worship at His throne Similar to the sign of Gods presence at Mount Sinai Expdus 191619 and in the Temple at its dedication Exodus 403438 the room is filled with clouds of smoke The sight before him strikes Isaiah a man of unclean lips silent and fearful as he stands before the great majesty of God Isaiahs fear of unworthiness is washed away as his lips are purified by the angel of the Lord As is often said God does not call the prepared He prepares the called Isaiah is now ready to receive his commission and is able to respond to the Lords call With this he is eagerly sent out as a zealous prophet of the Lord who will not waiver in his vocation amidst the many trials ahead of him As our first reading relates the calling of the prophet Isaiah our Gospel Luke 5111 relates the call of St Peter Jesus who is beginning his preaching alongside the Lake of Gennesaret enters the boat of St Peter and his companions as they are finishing their long night of fishing Though their night has ended with nothing to show for it St Peter responds to the Lords call to put out into the deep And in doing so their trust is greatly rewarded as their nets are overflowing with this miraculous catch What has just hap pened would appear to these fishermen not only improbable but nearly impossible St Peter is so moved that he falls at the Lords feet and like Isaiah proclaims his unworthi ness to even be in the presence of the Lord In meeting Jesus Christ however everything is changed At the feet of the Lord SimonPeter receives a new identity and a new calling He is no longer a simple fisherman but now a fisher of men This encounter with the Lord is so powerful that it leads Sts Peter James and John to abandon everything and follow after Him Though they may feel unworthy or that they have nothing to offer the Lord they still respond to His call They trust in Jesus words echoed to each and every one of us Do not be afraid If they are willing to trust in and follow after Him He will do the rest The Lord will never call us to do that which we cannot do Instead His grace will give us the strength and the courage to do that which He calls us to Wherever He might call us in life whatever vocation He has called us to He will be with us every step of the way When called by the Lord both the prophet Isaiah and St Peter believe themselves unwor thy to respond But both are reassured by the Lord and are able to follow after Him Speaking of his own call St Paul also believed himself unworthy to be an Apostle due to his prior persecution of the Body of Christ But St Paul acknowledges that God called him nonetheless and all that he has been able to do since comes from the grace of God Each time God calls He awaits our response Though we may feel unworthy like the prophet Isaiah St Peter or St Paul we must trust in He who calls us Through the grace of God all things become possible Just as Jesus called the Apostles amidst their own weaknesses so will He call us If we are willing to respond to His call to call out Here I am send me we will find ourselves serving the Lord in extraordinary ways in ways we never thought possible But before we can respond to the call we must first hear it Do we spend time in quiet prayer listening for His call in our lives each and every day Are we ready to respond to this call The Use of Incense in the Liturgy An Explanation Describing the Temple liturgy present before him today the prophet Isaiah states that the house was filled with smoke Isaiah 64 This imagery is mirrored by St John as he describes his vision of the heavenly liturgy in the Book of Revelation The smoke of incense along with the prayers of the holy ones went up before God Revelation 84 The offering of incense in worship served as a ceremonial precept under the Old Law indicating the unification of worship on earth with worship in heaven as it purified and cleansed the sacred space of the Temple The Church continues the use of incense in its liturgy representing the singular unity both on earth and in heaven of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ which we are made present to at the altar The visual imagery and the smell of the incense is to remind our earthly senses of the true transcendence of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass as we enter into the presence of God As the smoke rises we are to call to mind how our prayers and offer ings rise before God as St John relates The lingering smell of the incense calls to mind the lingering presence of Jesus Christ and His grace in our lives In Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF February 1617 2019 CANTORS 500 Leeann Kennerck 730 Mike
