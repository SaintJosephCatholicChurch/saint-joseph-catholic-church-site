  "text": "Pentecost Sunday June 5 2022 We welcome Msgr Michael Heintz academic dean of Mount St Mary's Seminary and Fr Stephen Felicichia parochial vicar of St Elizabeth Ann Seton in Fort Wayne as the celebrants of our Masses this weekend Next weekend we will welcome Fr Bill Sullivan as our celebrant special Thank You to Fairway Floor Covering and parishioner Kris Thompson for their work of laying new flooring in the Rectory over the past two weeks The work was finished just before I left for Washington DC and I was greatly impressed with their work I look forward to hosting an open house sometime this Fall to show off the work that has been done This weekend June 4th 5th the Church celebrates the great Solemnity of Pentecost Marking fifty days since Easter Sunday this celebration brings the Easter season to a close Traditionally this celebration is viewed as the second highest feast day of the year next only to Easter Sunday itself Similar to Easter Sunday we will hear a form of the Pentecost sequence before our Alleluia verse and Gospel reading The Pentecost sequence composed by the 12th Century Poet Adam of St Victor is known as the Veni Sancte Spiritus or Come Holy Spirit This sequence prayerfully reflects upon the mystery of the third person of the Most Holy Trinity the Holy Spirit Let us imitate this sequence's longing for the Holy Spirit who is coming that He may renew the face of the earth and dwell within us Traditionally June and July are months associated with the precious Body and Blood of our Lord In June we celebrate Corpus Christi highlighted by a diocesan wide Corpus Christi Procession in Warsaw on Sunday June 19th at 3 PM In July we are encouraged to offer the Votive Mass of the Most Precious Blood of Jesus originally celebrated on July 3rd on ferial days or days when there are no Saint's feast day celebrated Given this focus our bulletin cover will highlight a different Eucharistic miracle each weekend Eucharistic miracles are extraordinary events where the Eucharist no longer appears under the accidents of bread and wine but also in some form takes on the physical qualities of human flesh and blood Arriving in Washington DC This past Tuesday I arrived safely in Washington DC On Wednesday we began our June coursework Throughout the month I have two classes that meet daily Philosophy and the Theology of Law and Protection of Rights in the Administrative Life of the Church This first course is a theoretical overview of law itself of Church law and how we approach law today This study is known as the study of jurisprudence The second course is one that is a practical review while also being quite technical Placed as one of our last courses it combines a number of our previous courses together into one Through baptism we have been incorporated into the Body of Christ which is the Church We have certain responsibilities and rights as members of this body just as we do in society itself This course looks specifically at our various rights within the Church and what protections to those rights are contained within the law itself In addition to beginning classes I've also had the opportunity to meet with my cohort classmates We have not seen each other in person in three years We've already had a wonderful few days of re connecting Three years ago we started as a cohort of twenty This summer only seven of us remain Some of our fellow classmates left the program to return to full time ministry while others became full time students and completed the program this past year The remaining seven of us are looking forward to completing our coursework in the next two months Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday June 4 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm
