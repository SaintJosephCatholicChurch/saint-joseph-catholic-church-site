Passion March 24 2024 This weekend March 23rd 24th the Church celebrates Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion On this rare occasion we hear two gospel readings today That of our Lord's triumphal entry into Jerusalem and of His Passion Having these two Gospels proclaimed in one liturgy reminds us of the great drama that is unfolding during Holy Week Welcomed by great crowds into Jerusalem within five days those same crowds cry out Crucify Him I cannot encourage you enough to take part in the liturgies of the Paschal Triduum These three days begin Holy Thursday evening with the Mass of the Lord's Supper at 7 PM continues Good Friday with the Celebration of the Lord's Passion at 1 PM a truly unique celebration in our liturgical year and culminates with the magnificent Easter Vigil at 9 PM on Holy Saturday In these three days we are taken on a tour of the entirety of salvation history These three main liturgies which are truly one continuous liturgy are accented by a number of other celebrations including watching the Passion movie on Monday at 7 PM various times of confession throughout the week chances to join in the Liturgy of the Hours during the Paschal Triduum and the chance to walk the Stations of the Cross at 7 PM and join in our Tenebrae service at 8 PM on Good Friday evening All of these offerings are meant for one purpose To aid us in being led to a far deeper appreciation of the depths of everything that God has done for us Do not be afraid to think of Holy Week as a week of retreat In this week we have the opportunity to bring our Lenten journey to fulfilment and embrace the many graces that God has gifted to us in these forty days as we near the empty tomb We will have the full Easter season to truly unpack these graces The Chrism Mass at the Cathedral Have you ever attended the Chrism Mass It is the annual celebration of the institution of the priesthood one of the two principal mysteries of Holy Thursday along of course with the institution of the Eucharist At the Chrism Mass the Bishop consecrates the Sacred Chrism the oil used for the ordination of priests anointing after Baptism and for Confirmation He also blesses the Oil of the Sick and the Oil of Catechumens These oils will be sent out to the parishes of the diocese and presented to each parish at the Mass of the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday for use throughout the year In addition to the blessing of oils it is also the evening on which the priests of the diocese renew our priestly promises It is truly a unique and beautiful Mass If you have never attended before I encourage you to do so Tuesday March 26th at 7 PM at the Cathedral in Fort Wayne Holy Week Near and Far As a part of our outreach to our local community we sent out a county wide mailer this week with an invitation for all to join us for our celebration of the Paschal Triduum On the mailer we listed our primary Mass times for the Triduum Our full Holy Week schedule including additional confession times can be found in today's insert As we prepare for Holy Week may we also be prepared to welcome new guests into the life of our parish family For those who may be traveling this coming week due to Spring Break do not be afraid to enter the life of the parishes where you are visiting Part of the beauty of our Catholic Faith is seeing that the Church is truly catholic which means universal Though separated by distance we remain united as one in prayer You can find local Mass times wherever you may be traveling by using <a href=\"MassTimes.org\">MassTimes.org</a> or by calling
