  "text": "Fourth Sunday of Lent March 27 2022 special Thank You to our Knights of Columbus for their hard work on the Lenten Fish Fry this past Friday This year saw another record breaking year Thanks to the hard work and fundraising of both the Knights of Columbus and our GIRL's Night Out and your generous support we are on schedule to install our new parish playground this coming July This weekend the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday of Lent also known as Laetare Sunday This name is taken from the beginning of our entrance antiphon Laetare Jerusalem or Rejoice Jerusalem Marking the halfway point of Lent we are reminded of why we walk these forty days Every penitential season always gives way to a season of joy Just as Lent will give way to Easter Sunday so too does the Crucifixion give way to the Resurrection Though we celebrate our coming joy we do keep in mind that it is not yet here Similar to the Transfiguration the Church gives us this moment of joy to prepare us for what is to come Just as Peter James and John come down the mount of the Transfiguration they do so that they then might walk towards Mount Calvary and our Lord's Passion We in turn will move from Laetare Sunday this weekend into Passiontide next weekend when the statues and images in the Church will be veiled These forty days of prayer fasting and almsgiving are meant to draw us closer to the Lord We cannot approach the Resurrection without first walking the way of the Cross and joining our Lord on Mount Calvary By walking these forty days do we begin to understand the true gift that is our salvation in Jesus Christ If we have been lax or faltered in our Lenten disciplines let us renew our efforts to walk with the Lord here and now It is never too late to walk with the Lord who is always rejoicing to welcome home His prodigal son Luke 151 3 11 32 Lenten Parish Mission Join us for our Parish's Lenten Mission on Monday April 4th through Wednesday April 6th at 7:00PM each evening On Monday April 4th we will welcome Fr Dennis DiBenidetto pastor of St Robert Bellarmine in North Manchester as he prepares us for the coming Holy Week and Paschal Triduum On Tuesday April 5th we will have four priests available for our Lenten Penance Service And on Wednesday April 6th we will conclude with an evening Mass and extended homily Did You Know Justification in Action Continuing from our look at salvation last weekend cf Did You Know The Church and Salvation we now turn our attention to justification As this is often a matter of great contention in inter religious dialogue seen in this erroneous view Catholics think they are saved by good works it is a topic that must be approached with much patience Otherwise we may become lost in discussion by simply talking past one another The Catechism defines justification as the gracious action of God which frees us from sin and communicates the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ Romans 322 Justification is not only the remission of sins but also the sanctification and renewal of the interior man We receive this justification through Baptism the sacrament of faith Through justification the Holy Spirit bestows upon us the theological virtues of faith hope and love These three things unite us perfectly to Christ It is through these three virtues that we're able to do works which are pleasing to God These works are pleasing to God not because they're good works but because they are our faith being put into action through the virtue of charity It is an example of us living in the Holy Spirit and allowing the Holy Spirit to work through us Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday March 26 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Parish Family Sunday
