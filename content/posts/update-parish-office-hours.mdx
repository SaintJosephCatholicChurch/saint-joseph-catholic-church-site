<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>In accord with Governor Holcomb&rsquo;s &ldquo;Executive Order for Hoosiers to Stay at Home&rdquo;, which took effect yesterday evening (March 24, 2020) at 11:59 PM, our Parish Office will be closed to all public business from today until at least Wednesday, April 7th. We will remain available to you via phone (824-1380) and by email (stjosephchurch@adamswells.com) during our normal hours of operation (Mon-Fri, 9 AM - 4 PM) and, for emergencies, at all hours by the Parish Emergency Line (<a href="tel:(260) 296-0511">(260) 296-0511</a>).</p>
<p>As the Governor&rsquo;s executive order classifies churches as &ldquo;Essential Businesses and Operations&rdquo;, our church building itself will remain open at all hours<sup>*</sup> for those who desire to spend time in private and individual prayer before our Eucharistic Lord. Confessions will continue to be offered by appointment and at announced times.<sup>**</sup> If coming to the Church to pray, please be mindful of social distancing practices and keep at least six feet of space between yourself and others.</p>
<p>Let us continue to pray for one another and, in a special way, let us pray for all healthcare professionals who are working so hard to ensure public health and well-being. St. Joseph, Patron of the Universal Church and our Patron, pray for us!</p>
<p>Faithfully in Christ,<br>Fr. David</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Following Bishop Rhoades&rsquo; directives, the church building will be closed to the public when the live-streaming of our liturgies is occurring (M-F: 11:30 AM - 12 PM; Sat: 9 - 9:30 AM; Sun: 11 AM - 12 PM).</p>
<p>**Fr. David will be offering a &ldquo;Drive-Thru&rdquo; Confession this Saturday, March 28th, from 3-5 PM. What does this mean? Fr. David is sitting under the portico outside of the Church. If you are en-route on essential travel and are stopping at the Church, please drive under the portico for Confession. If there are multiple people in the car, we will step inside the main Church doors to preserve the confidentiality of the Sacrament. We are to be mindful of acting prudently at this time and observing all social distancing requirements.</p>
