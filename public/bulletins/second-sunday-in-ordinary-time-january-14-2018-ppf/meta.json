Cotterman Homily for the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time Year Fr Joseph Bolin a diocesan Priest in the Archdiocese of Vienna Dear brothers and sisters we stand today on the boundary between Christmas and the liturgical ordinary time The Christmas crib and Christmas trees are gone we are clothed in green for the cycle of ordinary time But the readings especially the Gos pel continue the grace and mystery of Christmas Jesus was born as a child came into the world and was revealed to it He showed himself to the world He also spoke and still speaks to the world in a particular way through his call of which we hear in the readings and in the Gospel Behold the Lamb of God says John These words which we hear at ever Mass are decisive words John was a charismatic man who excited and challenged people Disciples gathered around him But John does not want to remain his disciples He points to Jesus Behold the Lamb of God With this pointing he fulfills the mean ing of his own life Every one of us seeks meaning in life and find it in various ways But very few recognize the meaning of their life so clearly as John He lives he ex ists for one thing alone to point to Jesus That is the high point of his life with which he attains the greatest joy Now it but remains for Jesus to grow he John may di minish What does John set in motion At first glance it doesnt seem to be anything special We dont hear of any great stories any wonders any astonishing discoursesonly a few personal meetings and talks But these meetings and talks were unforgettable Certain special happenings a great unexpected success the news of a death or as sassination attempt the Yes of a beloved remain to their small details in our memory We recall where we were with whom when he happened and so on It was this way with the disciples who encountered Jesus This meeting made such an im pression on them that they could remember years later at what hour of the day it oc curred It was the tenth hour 4 PM And this meeting had so inspired them that they couldnt hold themselves back they had to go quickly to a relative or friend and say to them See whom we have found He is the one for whom we have all waited on whom we have set our hope John pointed to Jesus and the disciples followed him They felt his mysteriously at tractive power but did not yet really know him They wanted to know who he really is So they ask him Master where are you staying Where are you at home What is it like to live with you Jesus did not give them a quick answer but invited them Come and see Or rather come and you will see And this answer developed a life long for the disciples They learned through Jesus words and through experience that he is a special way present in the Eucharist as he promises He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him John 656 And they learned that Jesus is in all his beloved friends he lives in us when we allow him when we open ourselves to his love God calls everyone of us But there are many forms that Gods call takes It is few who are called as successors of the apostles It is perhaps few who experience Gods call in as impressive a way as Samuel But what is essential remains the same that there is someone from whom we somehow hear See him Listen to him He is the one who fulfills your longing and your hope who will make you happy and that we have the confidence to say this also to others Or as in Samuels case Listen to these words to this teaching to these thought Thus you will be led well And that we are seek to learn every more intimately who Jesus to ask him anew Where are you stay ing and to experience his presence with us in the celebration of the Eucharist and in our fellow men and women In this Mass let us pray that we who have heard and followed his call to faith may experience still more this longing to know him and believe and experience ever more strongly his presence among us Priests who will be helping with Masses while Msgr
