2023 special Welcome Home to our university students on their Christmas break and our service men and women on leave for the holiday We rejoice to join together with you as one family in prayer to start the Christmas season This weekend Dec 16th 17th the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Advent or Gaudete Sunday Marking the halfway point of Advent this Sunday receives its name from the first words of the Mass Introit or Entrance Antiphon from today's liturgy Gaudete in Domino or Rejoice in the Lord Those at our 10 AM Mass this weekend will hear our choir beautifully introduce our Mass with this antiphon before the opening hymn The antiphon like most antiphons is itself taken directly from the Sacred Scriptures This antiphon comes from St Paul's Epistle to the Philippians Rejoice in the Lord always again I say rejoice Indeed the Lord is near Phil 44 5 Though St Paul would have first established the Church in Philippi during his second missionary journey AD 50 he would have only written this epistle itself a decade later during his imprisonment in Rome How beautiful it is that St Paul though imprisoned and awaiting execution was still able to share these words Rejoice in the Lord always Offered as parting words and continued encouragement to the faithful in Philippi St Paul reminds them and us that despite all obstacles and trials in this life Jesus is still coming to us And for this we rejoice for the Lord is near Salvation Himself is nigh at hand God is with us Emmanuel We have nothing to fear This zealous joy is meant to overflow into our liturgy today The penitential practices of Advent briefly give way as we rejoice in the Lord Reflected not only in our entrance antiphon but also in the priest's vestments The violet of Advent is tinged with the gold of Christmas creating a beautiful rose color Worn only for this day we are reminded that our penance always has a purpose Our Advent practices are preparing us for Christmas and for Christ Given how short Advent is this year this Sunday quickly brings us right into the second half of the Advent season The second half of Advent which begins on December 17th turns our focus from the Second Coming to the his torical Incarnation of the Lord In a word our desire to prepare ourselves for our encounter with the Lord at the end of time is only possible because He first made Himself known to us in time This second half of Advent is greeted by the Antiphons leading us into our Christmas celebrations Each antiphon taken from the Prophet Isaiah is proclaimed throughout the Church's liturgy each day this week Each antiphon will be used as a part of both the Liturgy of the Hours and at Mass as the scriptural verse with the Gospel acclamation Please see this weekend's insert offering daily prayers to help us unite the Antiphons into our prayer life Advent Penance Service Join us this Wednesday Dec 20th for our Advent Penance Service from 600 7:00PM Following an introductory reflection we will have five priests available for individual confessions throughout the hour During Confession Adoration will be ongoing In the Sacrament of Confession the Lord has given us the gift of the forgiveness of our personal sins In our preparations for Christmas we often clean our homes so that we are ready to welcome guests for the holiday In this great Sacrament we have the chance to clean our hearts and souls to welcome Christ for the holy day Let us make use of this great gift in our preparations for Christmas and embrace the loving forgiveness and freedom found in Christ through this Sacrament Fourth Sunday of Advent Christmas Mass Obligations As a reminder we have two celebrations next weekend as we assist at two Masses Once for the Fourth Sunday of Advent and
