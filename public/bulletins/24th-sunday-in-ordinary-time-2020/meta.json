  "text": "WENTY OURTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME September 13 2020 Entering into the 24th Sunday in Ordinary Time Sept 12th13th we hear the closing portion of the fourth great discourse from St Matthews Gospel Last weekend we heard how to approach reconciliation with our brothers and sisters in our Christian community and how to approach reconciliation with God Now we hear of how important this reconciliation is to our conversion As we experience Gods infinite love and mercy in our lives so must we exercise it with others Christianity is unique among religions in our belief in the intensity of Gods love and closeness to us and Gods desire to forgive us That is not surprising since only Christianity enjoys the fullness of Gods self revelation in Jesus God revealed himself in Jesus and revealed his closeness to us and desire to forgive us Jesus is our model in forgiveness What Does It Mean To Be Catholic In the coming weeks well be announcing the start date for our Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults RCIA sessions Our weekly sessions will offer dynamic lessons and lively discussion regarding the fundamental teachings of our Catholic Faith The sessions will be open to all individuals parishioners and nonparishioners alike who are interested in learning or relearning the fundamentals of the Faith Our RCIA sessions are perfect for those who are Catholic and wish to deepen their knowledge about the Church for those who are not Catholic but wish to learn what it means to be Catholic and for those who wish to prepare for full initiation into the Church at the Easter Vigil If you know of anyone interested in learning more about the Catholic Church please consider personally inviting them to join us during these sessions and consider journeying with them The Perfect Season to Walk the Rosary Path As the temperature finds that perfect balance between Summer and Fall it is a wonderful time to be outside It is especially magnificent when a slight breeze comes rustling over the trees near the church As a reminder we have our wonderful Rosary Path on the parish campus just to the south of the Parish Office pictured on this weeks bulletin The Rosary Path serves as a beautiful and tranquil place of prayer and meditation surrounded by Gods glorious creation 34th Annual Bishops Appeal As of this mailing you either have or will shortly have received a letter from Bishop Rhoades kicking off the 34th Annual Bishops Appeal Included in this mailing is a personal letter from Bishop a brochure highlighting the various ministries that the appeal
