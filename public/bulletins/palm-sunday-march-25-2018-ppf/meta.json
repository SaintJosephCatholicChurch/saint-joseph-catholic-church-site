sisters in Christ the Lord be with you Today we begin the Holy Week From tomorrow Monday to Thursday inclusive have precedence over all other celebrations The Holy Week reminds us of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ the huge price He paid for our salvation It leads us to know that the suffering the death and the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ are together they form one episode They were and should be seen as the execution of Gods saving plan It is victory over sin and death Let us ac company the Lord Jesus to Jerusalem and to his eventually journey to Calvary to save mankind from eternal damnation and then rise with Him into glory Today we celebrate the triumphant entry of the Lord Jesus into his own city Jerusalem as the King to complete his work as our Messiah and Redeemer He entered Jerusalem to suffer die and rise from death into glory His suffering and death are not a defeat but victory over sin and death He humbled himself because of his love for us For us he did not shield his face from buffets and spitting saliva and offered his life on the cross What of your own life How do you see and deal with suffering in your life What do you think when you see your fellow human being die in suffering and dis tress Do you see the face of Christ in those suffering people Do you see Gods hand in those situations you find yourself Yes we need to see Gods hands in everything that happens to us Our consolation is in God for those who believe and accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Redeemer Listen to the First Reading from Prophet Isaiah Is 5047 He said The Lord God has given me a welltrained tongue that I might know how to speak to the weary I gave my back to those who beat me my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting The Lord God is my help therefore I am not disgraced knowing that I shall not be put to shame Yes for If we believe that Jesus died and rose so too will God through Jesus bring with him those who have fallen asleep 1 Thes 414 So the Lord Jesus is our consolation if only we believe in him The Lord triumphantly and in humility rod on a colt not in car or jeep or SUV or in an air bus Thus in the 2nd Reading Phil 2611 The Lord Jesus though He is God did not cling to His Divinity but humbled Himself and became a slave to save us He be came poor to make us rich Praise to Him Then in the Gospel Passion narrative Mk 1411547 Mark said it all He was rejected spat upon bitten scourged molested and crucified because of us What shall we do for him Let us each one of us repay him the way each of us feels fit and espe cially through our neighbors Let us treat our neighbor the way we should treat Jesus himself Happy Holy Week God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukw u Announcement Remember to attend all the Ceremonies in
