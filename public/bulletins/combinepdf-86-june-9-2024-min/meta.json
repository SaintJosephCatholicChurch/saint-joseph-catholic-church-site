Ordinary Time June 9 2024 This weekend June 8th 9th the Church celebrates the Tenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Though this is our third full week back in Ordinary Time this is our first weekend back in green vestments due to the number of solemnities that followed the Easter season We will liturgically remain in green for almost the remainder of the Church year 24 weeks before the year ends and starts anew with Advent on December 1 2024 This concept of Ordinary Time is itself somewhat new in the life of the Church though the liturgical color for this time has always been green Prior to the revision of the liturgical calendar in 1969 this time was known as Time after Pentecost with the time after Christmastide being Time after Epiphany This transition to Ordinary Time was actually meant to emphasize a season distinct from Christmastide and Eastertide While the other four seasons Advent Christmas Lent and Easter focus on specific mysteries within the life of Christ this ordinary time is meant to recall the very mystery of the life of Christ in its fullness As such the majority of the liturgical year is truly meant as a time for growth and maturation in the life of every Christian We are called to put into action in our lives that which we have seen in the life of Christ Though we will remain in Ordinary Time for several months the true meaning of the season is only fully reflected in its last Sunday the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ King of the Universe The mystery of the life of Christ is called to penetrate ever more deeply into human history until all things are finally caught up in Christ And this begins right here and now as we allow Christ to enter more fully into and be reflected through our lives Corpus Christi Procession At the close of our 10 AM Mass last Sunday we took to the streets of our community for our Corpus Christi Eucharistic Procession Being our first procession to go off campus in living memory possibly the first ever we rejoiced to be joined by 92 parishioners in procession How beautiful a witness as we walked along State Road 1 Madison Street and into William Wells Circle following after our Eucharistic Lord Though overcast and humid we processed 06 miles with four stops along the way At each stop we heard Scripture readings with Eucharistic themes and entered together in to prayer As we moved along in procession we joined in singing hymns and reciting both the Divine Mercy Chaplet and the Litany of the Eucharist Benediction was given at our last stop right at Noon with the Church bells ringing in the distance It is my hope and prayer that this is the start of an annual tradition for our parish as future eucharistic processions will always now take us off campus and into our local community Such a liturgical practice reminds us in a clear way that we are called to go out and bring Jesus to others to those we meet in our daily lives It is also an opportunity for implicit evangelization as those who see such processions may be drawn to learn more about the Eucharist special Thank You to all those who assisted with our Corpus Christi Procession this past weekend Our Parish Choir concluding for their summer break not only led us beautifully throughout Mass but also in procession Our Knights of Columbus including our 4th Degree St Joseph Color Guard helped to carry the canopy and lead our procession Our Servers led by Dan our Master of Ceremonies masterfully guided us along And finally those who lent us their driveways and homes as stations along the way special Thank You to Fr Bill Sullivan who will be with us for Masses this Tuesday through Thursday while I am away for a short time of retreat Priests are required by canon law to make five days of retreat every year emphasizing the importance of one's spiritual health Though I normally make this time of retreat in the winter with my seminary classmates I was not able to do so this year and will instead make two short retreats this summer PARISH CALENDAR Sat June 8 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sat June 8Sun June 9St Francis Summer Reading Program begins this weekend through August 4th Sun June 9 Mass 7:30am Mass
