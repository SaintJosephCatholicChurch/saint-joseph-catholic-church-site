  "text": "HIRTY HIRD UNDAY I RDINARY IME OVEMBER 14 2021 This weekend November 13th14th marks the penultimate weekend of the liturgical year It is our last green Sunday in Ordinary Time as next weekend we celebrate the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe with gold vestments and then enter into the Advent season with violet vestments the following Sunday Entering into Advent we will begin anew our yearly opportunity to walk alongside the life of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Sacred Scriptures As this Advent will bring us into Year of the threeyear lectionary cycle we will primarily walk with our Lord through the Gospel of St Luke this coming year Though a new liturgical year is approaching two weekends still remain The theme of our readings today continues with the same focus of the past few weekends regarding the cost of discipleship As we are nearing the end of the liturgical year however there is also a focus on the end times in our First Reading Daniel 1213 and the Gospel Mark 132432 This focus however is not meant to cause fear but reassurance Instead it is meant to remind us that our Lord walks with each of His disciples and will lead His Bride the Church safely to the end of her pilgrimage DVENT FFERINGS VENTS As we prepare for the Advent season there will be several upcoming activities and events to help move us towards the holidays and more importantly the holy day May these various opportunities aide us in our charitable outreach and our parish fraternity Starting this weekend the Blessing Tree is present in the narthex This yearly
