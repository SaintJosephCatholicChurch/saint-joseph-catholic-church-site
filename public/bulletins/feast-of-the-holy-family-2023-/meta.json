Joseph December 31 2023 This weekend the Church continues her celebrations within the Christmas Octave with the Feast of the Holy Family of Jesus Mary and Joseph This feast finds its roots with the founding of the Confraternity of the Holy Family in Montreal in 1663 By 1684 this devotion to the Holy Family led to the creation of a liturgical feast day for the Holy Family that was celebrated throughout the Archdiocese of Montreal Initially celebrated the Sunday after the Epiphany this feast was moved into the Easter season to allow for great celebration outside of Montreal's harsh winters In the 19th Century this devotion to the Holy Father was heavily promoted by Pope Leo XIII The Holy Father saw this devotion as an antidote to the troubles plaguing the family in a newly industrialized world In an 1891 papal encyclical Leo XIII referred to the family as the cradle of civil society and by 1893 instituted the Feast of the Holy Family as a liturgical celebration to be celebrated in any diocese that requested it Sharing the same concerns as his predecessor Pope Benedict XV placed this feast day on the liturgical calendar of the universal Church in 1921 It was his hope that following the First World War devotion to the Holy Family would lead to a renewal of both familial and societal life This feast seeks to portray the Holy Family of Nazareth as the true model of life from which our own families can draw inspiration and find help and comfort This New Year's Eve December 31st we will once count down the sec onds to say farewell to this past year and welcome a new year in the Lord Continuing with our New Year's tradition these past few years you are invited to choose a Saint to get to know throughout the new year As we know however in the wise and loving plan of Jesus Christ it is not we who choose the Saint but the Saints who chooses us You can find a basket in the narthex with little strips of paper each with a Saint's name and a little biographical information for you to take with you This practice first started by Saint Faustina Kowalska of the Divine Mercy apparition invites us to spend the year learning about our Saint both histori cally and spiritually In inviting these Saints into our lives they become inter cessors on our behalf before the Lord James 517 amid the coming graces and challenges of the New Year As is the custom our New Year's celebrations are often marked by making resolutions for the New Year This year one of my resolutions is to spend a greater amount of time studying the early Church Fathers These titans of our Faith though often overlooked are a true source of a treasury of spiritual insights into the life of the Lord and the early days of the Church I hope to be able to share some of what I learn with you in the coming New Year Mary Mother of God On Monday January 1st the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Mary Mother of God This ancient celebration is traced back to at least the 5th Century and the Council of Ephesus This ecumenical council recognized Mary as Theotokos or God bearer As this celebration falls on Monday this year though a holy day it is not a holy day of obligation this year Though not a holy day of obligation it can be seen as a holy day of opportunity To celebrate this solemnity and mark the end of the Christmas Octave join us for a special Mass for this solemnity on Monday January 1st at 7 PM Faithfully in Christ Fr David special Thank You to all those who have helped make this Christmas season so beautiful Our Choir Children's Choir cantors and musicians put much effort and practice into ensuring that our Masses were accompanied with beautiful music Our Decorating Committee with only a short window to work transformed the Church beautifully for the Christmas season Our Parish Office and Staff were as always an invaluable assistance throughout Advent and into the Christmas season Thank You again to the many hands that helped lead us into this
