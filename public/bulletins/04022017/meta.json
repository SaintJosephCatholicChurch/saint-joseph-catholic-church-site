Cook Michael Green and George Bitzer 5TH SUNDAY IN LENT APRIL 2ND 2017 YR From the Pastors Desk THE HOPE OF RESURRECTION IS THE DEFEAT OF SIN SUFFERING PAIN AND DEATH Remember 1 The Lenten Penance Service Confessions Reconciliation is on Monday April 3 2017 2 The confession is for all in our parish including the Religious education stu dentsthe youth who did not join their class when they had Lenten Confessions last Sunday However there will be still Confession for them next Sunday 492017 3 The Story of the Two Bottles Vs Two Souls Dust off from your soul the dust of sin Jesus is our Resurrection and life because He has given us the Spirit We are no longer dead because of sin but alive Fore in Jesus there is fullness of redemption In the 1st Reading today Ez 371214 from Prophet Ezekiel God promises us the resurrection It is raising us from the defeat of the slavery of sin from humiliation and from despair to hope of the resurrection It reads Oh my people I will open your graves and have you rise from them and bring you back to the land of Israel Then you shall know that I am the Lord when I open your graves I will put my spirit in you that you may live This is the promise the Lord made to us if we strive and obey him Thus if we persevere and overcome sin and its consequences which Paul talks of in the 2nd reading Rom 8811 we shall really be the people of God Pray and overcome all sins such sins as hatred rivalry jealousy outburst of anger self ishness envy drunkenness immorality impurity etc If we overcome these and many others of their kind then we live in the spirit of love joy peace patience kindness generosity faithfulness gentleness selfcontrol etc This is life in the spirit This is the hope of Resurrection In the gospel Jn 11145 Lazarus was raised from death to life by Christ Jesus He also raised the daughter of Jairus the synagogue official and the son of a widow of Nain Lk 71117 In the Acts of the Apostles 20910 a sleeping boy dur ing homily fell from 3rd floor and died He was raised to life by Paul So be careful do not fall asleep during homily so that you do not fall from your seat as Eutychus fell These are not real Resurrection of the dead itself but they showed the hope of the resurrection So we need to persevere in our struggle over sin which causes spiritual death and thus deprives the sinner the life and joy of the Resurrection into life Think of the farmers how they endure the pain and suffering of planting They first till the ground sow the seeds weed the farm water the farm and wait for some time Then they harvest the crops and only then we have food on our tables To eat someone must suffer in the kitchen cooking the food and then comes the joy of eating and drinking So you must persevere in suffering and endure the pains in life doing good in order to rise to joy of the resurrection when we shall possess glorified bodies like that of Christ Jesus our Lord and Master Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu SCRIPTUREMASS READINGS FOR THE WEEK Mon April 3 Fifth Week of Lent Dn 1319151719303362 Tues April 4St Isidore Bishop and Doctor
