  "text": "Twenty Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time September 17 2023 This weekend Sept 16th 17th the Church celebrates the Twenty Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time For our local community it is also the time that we are gearing up towards Street Fair Similar to last year our parish will have a table setup on Washington St near the Library I'm hoping to be out at the table most evenings to provide information about our parish to all those interested Make sure to stop over and say Hi if you see me as we will have a number of things to hand out Last weekend was the first weekend for our new year of Religious Education Our Kindergarten through High Schoolers met to begin the year together in prayer Our high schoolers led all of our students in the Holy Rosary and I was able to offer a special blessing as we began this new year of learning On this Sunday often referred to as Catechetical Sunday throughout the country please remember to offer a prayer for our 103 students and 27 catechists and aides at the start of this new year We welcome the return of our Adult Choir at the 10 AM Mass this weekend Our Adult Choir will assist us in praying the Mass on the first and third Sundays of the month at the 10 AM Mass and also on special solemnities and feast days such as Christmas Eve and the Easter Vigil If you are interested in learning more about or joining the choir make sure to stop by for their practice time every Wednesday evening following the 7:00PM evening Mass At the 10 AM Mass this weekend we will hear the choir sing the Communion Antiphon prior to the distribution of Holy Communion As a parish we have heard this antiphon recited at every Mass since we resumed public Masses back in May of 2020 The Communion Antiphon along with the Entrance Antiphon and the Offertory Antiphon is itself a text or truly a hymn provided by the Church to be used on specific days throughout the year Each antiphon is itself a hymn in that it not only has the refrain that we have heard over the past few years but also has verses Both Sacrosanctum Concilium Para 30 of the Second Vatican Council and the General Instruction of the Roman Missal GIRM Para 48 87 encourage parishes to utilize these texts in the liturgy Realistically due to a delay in their translation following the council their use in the liturgy has over the years been replaced by general hymnody Part of the beauty of these antiphonal hymns is their rich scriptural content Both refrain and verses are taken from the Scriptures that pertain to the specific Mass that we pray that very day It is because of such things as these that we can say he Mass is one long biblical prayer a tapestry woven from a fabric of biblical passages phrases and allusions This is no accident In the Mass the story of salvation told in the Bible continues in our lives Dr Scott Hahn When we enter into the Christmas Season we will hear our choir lead us in prayer not only through our hymnody but also in these antiphonal hymns By incorporating these hymns into our normal liturgical use as encouraged by the Church Herself we will be able to continue fully surrounding ourselves with the Sacred Scriptures Many of the verses taken from the Psalms will ideally settle into our hearts and souls as the antiphonal hymns themselves reveal the mystical content of that which they musically bring to our ears Cemetery Altar Nearing Completion The grounds of our cemetery will soon have an altar at its very center serving as a constant reminder of the prayers that we offer up for our deceased loved ones Prepared by Fynders Keepers out of Stilwell Kansas the altar is here pictured The center panel will have three lilies behind a t square both symbols commonly connected to St Joseph Please Note Due to Street Fair
