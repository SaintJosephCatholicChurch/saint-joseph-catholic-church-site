  "text": "Fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time February 5 2023 This weekend February 4th5th the Church celebrates the Fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time formerly known as Septuagesima Sunday This Sunday marks three Sundays until Ash Wednesday and nine Sundays until Easter As Lent is one of the principal seasons of the liturgical year it is meant to be a powerful time to excite the heart and renovate our whole spiritual life in preparation for Easter Sunday Given the great expectations for the coming Lenten season the Church observes these next three weekends as a time of preparation for what is to come During this time we are urged to discern what Lenten penances and observances we may be called to keep this year We are to spend this time preparing our hearts for this coming Lent as we will soon hear that solemn reminder given to us by the Church gives to us on Ash Wednesday Remember you are dust and to dust you shall return Following the Feast of St Blaise this past Friday we are offering the Blessing of Throats after all Masses this weekend It is recorded that while imprisoned during the persecution of Emperor Diocletian many sick people attracted by the reputation of his sanctity came to St Blaise and he healed them Included among the many who sought healing was a young boy with a fish bone lodged in his throat that St Blaise miraculously healed In addition to these miraculous healings St Blaise is also exemplified for his witness to the Faith He was twice brought before the local governor and given the chance to reject Jesus Christ and save his own life Each time he refused he was brutally beaten and tortured before finally being beheaded Though suffering throughout this time he continued to nobly give testimony to the Faith and preached the joy of Jesus Christ to his executioners The Roman Canon Continued Last weekend we completed the first of the two listings of Saints in the Roman Canon or Eucharistic Prayer I In the prayers between these two listings we hear three other biblical names mentioned Abel Genesis 44 Abraham Genesis 22 and Melchizedek Genesis 1418 20 Each of these three offered a sacrifice which was found pleasing to God In the same way we ask the Father to find acceptable the sacrifice made present within the Mass The gift of his own Son to which we now unite our lives upon the altar The remaining fifteen names now reference various martyrs The first two names are perhaps the most well known of those listed St John the Baptist and St Stephen the first martyr Acts 7 Their inclusion and the specific prayers preceding this listing speak to a union of the Roman Canon with the Eucharistic Prayers used in the Divine Liturgy of St Mark which was the primary form of liturgy utilized in Alexandria during the early first centuries It is worth remembering that the Roman Canon is specific to the Catholic Church in the west Our brothers and sisters who are members of our various Eastern Catholic Churches celebrate the Divine Liturgy Though the structures and the basics are the same our particular liturgical practices both east and west have been influenced by the cultures under which they organically developed Welcome Fr Bill Starting on Tuesday Fr Bill Sullivan will be with us throughout this week and weekend for all Masses and times of Adoration and Confession special Thank You to him for his assistance to our parish I had originally intended to be away throughout next week with my seminary classmates for our yearly gathering and enlisted Fr Bill's help in anticipation of this upcoming absence change in plans however will see me using this week as a stay cation for both prayer and a chance to work on my thesis With both parish and tribunal ministry I have not had much time to dedicate on writing my thesis With the majority of my research completed and outlines prepared I am hoping to complete the bulk of thesis writing over this coming week MASS INTENTIONS Saturday
