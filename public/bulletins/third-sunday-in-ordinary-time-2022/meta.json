  "text": "HIRD UNDAY I RDINARY IME ANUARY 23 2022 This weekend January 22nd 23rd the Church celebrates the Third Sunday in Ordinary Time Two years ago Pope Francis in his apostolic letter Aperuit illis Instituting the Sunday of the Word of God declared this weekend to also be referred to as Word of God Sunday When reflecting upon the weekend readings the connection becomes quite clear Each reading is connected to the Sacred Scriptures in some way This connection is found in the reading of the Scriptures in both our First Reading and the Gospel signifying the role of prophets in teachings in our Second Reading or in recognizing the beauty and transcendence of the word itself as seen in our Responsorial Psalm In the words of the Psalmist Your words Lord are Spirit and life When reflecting on the words of the Psalmist we might see how true these words are On this Word of God Sunday and every Sunday and at every Mass the Liturgy of the Word prepares us to enter into the Liturgy of the Eucharist In hearing the Word of God proclaimed we are prepared to receive the very Word of God Jesus Christ Himself in the Holy Eucharist ID OU NOW HE IBLE IS ATHOLIC OOK You may remember that our Christmas gift to the parish in 2020 was Jimmy Akins The Bible is a Catholic Book Though a bit of a provocative title the book itself is quite simple In four chapters Jimmy Akin provides a thorough overview of the historical origins and formulation of the Sacred Scriptures as we know them today The Sacred Scriptures are not only inspired by the Holy Spirit but are in themselves historical They were written and exist in time There even exists a moment in time twotothree whole decades after which our Lord Himself had already lived died and rose from the dead but there was not yet a written account of His life Once the last of the Sacred Scriptures had been written the canon as we know it today would not be fully compiled for nearly two whole centuries until the Church called the Council of Rome Though it is easy to take for granted in our modern day we cannot ignore the historical reality of the Sacred Scriptures The Catholic Church when looking at liturgical use determined which books were to be accepted as canonical and inspired authentic Once compiled the Church preserved and preached the Scriptures Finally the Church through Her Magisterium Teacher has and continues to serve as the authentic interpreter and guardian of the Sacred Scriptures cf 2 Thessalonians 215 2 Peter 121 Having received such an amazing gift from the Church we also gain a responsibility to make use of it When attending Mass most of what we say and hear is itself scriptural But this should not be our only experience with the Sacred Scriptures The Sacred Scriptures should themselves be a part of our daily lives And in making the Sacred Scriptures a part of our lives we shall see how this lifesaving Word changes us When speaking of those who read the Sacred Scriptures Pope Francis recounts that the sweetness of Gods word leads us to share it with all those whom we encounter in this life and to proclaim the sure hope that it contains cf 1 Pet 315 16 Make we take this gift use it in our own lives and then share it with all that we meet For this is a gift that leads to eternal life As has been true for two millennia the Bible is a Catholic book and it is a book that we are called to use Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday January 22 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Paris Family Sunday
