Ordinary Time This will be our last Sunday in Ordinary Time for several months as we begin our forty days of prayer fasting and almsgiving on Ash Wednesday Following the penitential season of Lent we spend fifty days rejoicing in the resurrection throughout Eastertide Even when Eastertide concludes on Pentecost several special weekend celebrations will follow Though it will quickly pass into Lent we do not want to overlook this Sunday in Ordinary Time For through our readings this weekend the Lord continues to offer us sound wisdom for how to live our lives We not only seek others to emulate such as the Saints but must also live lives worth emulating ourselves Holiness is a universal call to all people ourselves included We can embrace this wisdom and let it guide us as we begin our Lenten journey Beginning our Lenten Journey Ash Wednesday As our forty days of prayer fasting and almsgiving begin this Wednesday we will offer three Mass times for Ash Wednesday March 5th at 7:00AM Noon and 7:00PM As is custom in our country we will offer the imposition of ashes during each Mass Ashes have a long scriptural history as an outward sign of grief humility mourning and penance This outward sign is meant to steady our inward heart for the coming forty days of growing in Christ Please remember Ash Wednesday March 5th is a day of abstinence and fasting On this day we abstain from meat as we will also do every Friday throughout Lent and limit ourselves to one normal and two small meals throughout the day These biblical practices of fasting Matthew 914 15 and abstinence Daniel 102 3 strengthen our self discipline and remind us of our true end which is not here on earth but in heaven Lenten Devotions In addition to our personal Lenten observances that we discern to follow this year the parish is offering a number of additional opportunities for prayer throughout Lent This not only includes our regular weekday Mass Adoration and Confession schedules but also a number of special Lenten offerings added to the schedule Make sure to follow along with the Parish Calendar in the bulletin each weekend for a full schedule of these offerings Starting this Friday March 7th we will begin our weekly Soup Suppers from 600 6:40PM in the Parish Social Hall followed by Stations of the Cross at 7 PM in the Church Our diocesan wide The Light is On For You Campaign offers confession in every parish next Tuesday March 11th from 600 8:00PM Our parish Lenten Penance Service will be on Wednesday April 2nd from 600 7:00PM In addition to all this we will also be hosting a
