  "text": "HIRD UNDAY OF DVENT ECEMBER 13 2020 special Thank You to Fr Stephen Felicichia for his reflections during our Advent Parish Mission Focusing on the supernatural Fr Felicichia reminded us of how the supernatural breaks forth into the world This is clearly seen on Christmas Day when the chorus of angels appeared to the shepherds the north star guided the wise men and most importantly the Word of God Himself became flesh This truth however did not end on Christmas Day The supernatural continues to break forth into the world even today We see this most truly in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the Sacraments in which God offers to flood His graces into our lives At the Mass we are made present to Calvary In the Sacraments the salvation wrought by the Paschal Mystery is made available to us God is the author of the sacraments and liturgy and through them we allow Him to enter into the world and into our lives This weekend Dec 12th13th we look ahead to the joy that is to come as we celebrate the Third Sunday of Advent or Gaudete Sunday The word gaudete comes from the Latin verb gaudere which means to rejoice Looking at the syntax gaudete is in the imperative form or in English is given as a command We are called to rejoice This is reflected in our Introit or the Entrance Antiphon which is taken from St Pauls Epistle to the Philippians We rejoice as we acknowledge that our penitential Advent journey will soon give way to the great joy of Christmas Day This joy is reflected in our liturgy this weekend in the color rose Rose mixes the violet of Advent a penitential color with the gold of Christmas a color of joy and points us toward the rosecolored dawn which accompanies the rising of the sun over the horizon and overcomes the darkness of night For this reason the priest wears rosecolored vestments and the third candle of our Advent wreath to be lit is the rosecolored candle Now is the time when the Church begins to rejoice in earnest for the coming of the Savior This weekend we have been given another wonderful reason to rejoice This past Tuesday on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception Pope Francis has declared it to be the Year of St Joseph Writing in his newly released Apostolic Letter Patris corde With a Fathers Heart the Pope has declared this year in honor of the 150th anniversary of the declaration of St Joseph as the Patron of the Universal Church In Patris corde Pope Francis highlights the ordinary and the everyday people and experiences of life that offer us hope Like St Joseph these often go unnoticed serving as a daily discreet and hidden presence But like St Joseph these can play an incomparable role in the history of salvation Over the next year we are called to meditate upon and learn from the life of St Joseph As the fosterfather of our Lord St Joseph has become a father an example and a model to each of us as well And we as a parish placed under his spiritual patronage have so much that we can learn from him Faithfully in Christ Fr David For your planning purposes our Mass times for Christmas will be Christmas Eve 4:00PM 6:00PM and Midnight Christmas Day 8:00AM and 10:00AM Overflow seating
