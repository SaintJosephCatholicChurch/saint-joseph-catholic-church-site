<p>Due to Fr. David's summer class schedule through the Catholic University of America (CUA), we will need to make changes to our daily Mass schedule for the next two months.</p>
<p>Throughout the month of June, daily Mass on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday will be at 11:30 AM. Our Wednesday (7:00 PM) and Saturday (8:00 AM) times will remain the same.</p>
<p>July Daily Mass times are still pending.</p>
<p>Thank you for your flexibility and understanding.</p>
