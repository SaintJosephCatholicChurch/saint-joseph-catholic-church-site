understand more vividly the Scripture passages It is from April 23 to May 2 2018 If you intend to go please call <a href=\"Ja.net\">Ja.net</a> Lehman <a href=\"tel:(260)824-0367\">(260)824-0367</a> or Stacey Cou lardot <a href=\"tel:(260)466-1224\">(260)466-1224</a> or Parish Office at <a href=\"tel:(260)824-1380\">(260)824-1380</a> or the organizing agency The Brochures are available at the Narthex Today is the second Sunday of Lent and I hope that everybody is doing his or her best to live in the spirit of Lent Try and prepare this Lent as if it will be your last lent and as if your salvation depends on doing it well We are assured that if God is with us no one can be against us Sometimes in life we can experience obscurity dark ness that can constitute severe mental pain and physical suffering It can be when we have doubt about our faith or when we are sick or when we have some problems diffi culties at home in places of work agony in studies name them It can also be when there is problem in keeping the values we cherish such love fidelity unresolved confu sion about things and persons around us Todays Liturgy deals with such problems and it will help us to cope up if we can turn to God with faith trusting that he will help us Thus in the first reading today Gn 2212 9a 1013 1518 Abraham is a clas sic example of man of faith honest and trust You can imagine the gravity of his psychic agony when he was asked to offer his only son Isaac the child of his old age He knew that Isaac was a miracle child and if God wants him Isaac God will still fulfill the promise he made Therefore trusting in God Abraham was truly ready to slaughter Isaac Timely God intervened and prevented the slaughter of the boy and said Do not lay your hand on the boy because you acted as you did in not withholding from me your beloved son I will bless you abundantly and in your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessingall this because you obeyed my command You see my dear brothers and sisters in Christ that If God is for us who can be against us This is the opening sentence of the second reading from the letter of St Paul to the Romans Rom 831b34 No one can really destroy us when God is with us and for us So let us be with the Lord that the Lord God will be with us and for us And in the Gospel Mk 9210 The Lord Jesus took Peter James and John to mountain Tabor there He was transfigured and showed his Divine Majesty He showed them his divinity to strengthen the faith of the three against the scandal of the Cross which Jesus was discussing with Moses and Elijah In amazement Peter cried out Rabbi it is good that we are here Let us make three tents one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah You can see the link of the Gospel and the first reading and Gods assured intervention in the second reading The agony Abraham experienced when he was about to slaughter his son and eventually Gods intervention and the Lords cruci fixion and the glorious resurrection are related You see that For those who loves God everything works onto good Like Abraham and like Jesus we must suffer physical and mental pains in our jour ney to heaven And like them we will overcome all those pains Let our prayer be God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference cf St Francis of Assisi God bless you Rev Fr Pius Ilechukwu NB Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it The amount needed each week to make budget is 511640 We are 37716 ahead of budget from last
