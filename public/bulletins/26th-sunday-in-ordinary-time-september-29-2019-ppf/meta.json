letter from Bishop Rhoades regarding the Annual Bishops Appeal We will have the opportunity to view a video highlighting the different ministries supported by the Annual Appeal before our Masses on the weekend of Oct 12th13th Our support of this appeal helps to fund the majority of our dioceses charitable work and outreach through out northernIndiana I would ask you to prayerfully discern over the next few weeks how we can best support the Annual Appeal and aim to reach our financial goal of 3476435 All funds collected above this goal will be returned to our parish to be used at our discretion Your generosity to the Annual Appeal this past year di rectly helped to install a security system within the Church allowing the Church to remain open at all hours as a place for prayer and aided in the exterior and in terior lighting improvements to be completed in the coming weeks Parish Update Hearing Assistance System This past Thursday Stylus Technologies installed our new hearing as sistance system in the Church This system is connected directly to the Churchs sound system and makes available a handheld hearing assist device for use with any type of headphones or ear buds by plugging into the devices headphone jack These handheld devices will be stored and charged in the Ushers Room at the back of Church Please ask an Usher or myself if you are in need of a device or in need of assistance in operating it At the moment we have four handheld devices available for use by pa rishioners and visitors More handheld devices can also be added to the system in the future if there is a need to do so While ear buds will also be available in the Ushers Room you are welcome to bring personal ear buds to use with the hear ing assistance device As this is a new system I thank you for your patience as we make adjustments and fully implement the devices If you make use of one of the handheld devices please return the device to the Ushers Room after Mass so that it can be recharged and used for the next Mass Pet Blessing and Parish Picnic On Friday October 4th the Church will celebrate the Feast of St Francis of Assisi St Francis founded the Franciscan Order in the
