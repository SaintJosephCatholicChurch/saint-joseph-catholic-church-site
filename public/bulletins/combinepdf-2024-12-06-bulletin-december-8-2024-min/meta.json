Advent Given how near Christmastide is the Church now begins to turn her attention from the Second Coming of Christ at the end of time itself to His first coming in time at the Nativity This shift is seen in our Gospel today through the words of St John the Baptist the forerunner and herald of the Christ His words bore witness to the Redeemer's coming With the start of the new liturgical year last weekend we also began a new year in our three year lectionary cycle Having entered into Year of the cycle we are now walking through the life of our Lord according to the Gospel of St Luke This Gospel is itself divided into four main sections The Infancy Narratives Luke 1 2 the Early Ministry Luke 3 9 the Travel Narrative Luke 10 19 and Holy Week Luke 20 24 Briefly breaking these four sections apart we see that in Lukes account of Jesus life we will walk through 1 His birth in Bethlehem and upbringing in Nazareth Luke 1 2 2 Nearly one year of His ministry in Galilee Luke 3 9 3 The momentous death march to Jerusalem in the final year of His life Luke 10 19 and 4 The dramatic events of His Passion by which He ushered in the New Covenant Luke 20 24 see especially 2220 This Gospel is the first of a two volume work continued in the Acts of the Apostles St Luke first shows how God's promises to Israel are fulfilled in Jesus and how the salvation promised to Israel and has been accomplished by Jesus and extended to the Gentiles Continuing in Acts there is the assurance that the historical ministry of Jesus is continued in the ministry of the apostles and this ensures the fidelity of the Church's teaching to the teaching of Jesus Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception Holy Day of Obligation On Monday December 9th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception which is a Holy Day of Obligation Though this celebration normally falls on December 8th it was transferred this year as its original date falls on the Second Sunday of Advent Given that our nation has been entrusted to the Blessed Mother under this title this is our nation's patronal feast day and as such one we desire to celebrate yearly To help provide for our obligation to assist at Mass on this day we will offer Masses for the Holy Day of Obligation on Monday December 9th at 7:00AM Noon and 7:00PM Additional Holy Day Mass Times at surrounding parishes St Aloysius in Yoder
