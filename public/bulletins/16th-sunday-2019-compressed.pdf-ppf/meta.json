SIXTEENTH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME July 21 2019 Within the National Shrine of the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception are over 80 chapels dedicated to our Blessed Mother These chapels high light Mary as she is honored by the various cultures nationalities and eth nicities that make up our countrys rich heritage Each of these 80 chap els hold a special beauty and great significance to so many as we give proper honor to Mary Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ On our bulletin cover is Our Lady of iluva Chapel a chapel dedicated to the special devotion of our Blessed Mother held by those of Lithuanian descent The mosaic at the foot of the altar shows the different sizes and shapes of typical Lithuanian tree crosses Surrounding the archway are the words Mary console the children of a land sprinkled with blood and tears This prayer is a reference to the suffering of Lithuanians who held fast to our Faith during Communist persecution throughout the 20th Cen tury Parish Updates We are excited to begin our Parking Lot Project this coming week As we proceed with this necessary maintenance we are ensuring the integrity of the lot for years to come Brooks Construction will be on the campus over the next few weeks during weekdays to proceed with major construction We will also be working with local Libys Stripe Right regard ing restriping of the parking lot throughout the construction process We hope that there will be minimal parking inconvenience for our weekend Masses and I thank you for your patience throughout this time In addition to our Parking Lot Project weve used this as an oppor tune time to continue moving forward with our parish Security Project If you may recall our 2018 Annual Bishops Appeal overage was dedicated towards increased security on our campus The first phase of this project included installing a security system within the Church which was com pleted several months ago This next phase includes improving the exte rior lighting surrounding our campus As is quite noticeable in the evenings our parking lot is dimly lit This can make crossing the parking lot quite hazardous especially in the winter months for our Saturday Vigil and Sunday 7 AM Mass crowds For this reason we are working with Electric Company Inc to improve the exterior lighting throughout our parish campus As you may have seen when parking today Electric spent this past week laying conduit in the parking lot as the first step in this project This work was timed to coin cide with our Parking Lot Project to minimize necessary construction in the parking lot We will continue moving forward with this project over the next several months My profound gratitude to our Building Board Committee Parish Council Finance Council parish staff and all those who are assisting in these projects special Thank You also to all of you for your patience and understanding due to any inconvenience this needed work may cause and your generous stewardship that has ensured that these projects will come to completion Your continued generosity to our monthly Repair Rainy Day Fund ensures this necessary upkeep of our campus for the years to come It is my prayer that we continue to be prudent stewards of all that has been given to us and that all of this work is always done ad majrem Dei glriam for the greater glory of God Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF JULY 2728 2019 CANTORS 500
