Frances Carr and Kelsey Peters 3RD SUNDAY OF LENT MARCH 4TH 2018 YR WE ARE CALLED TO KEEP THE LAWS OR THE COMMAMNDMENTS OF GOD AND TO WORSHIP HIM My dear brothers and sisters in Christ the Lord be with you I want to remind our selves of our Parish Mission Week which starts today Please make effort to come for the talks and be spiritually uplifted Thanks in a distinct way to the members of the Parish Staff and the Parish Pastoral Council for their decent work prepar ing and arranging things May God continue to bless you all We are happy that we are a nation ruled by law and not by individual whims and ca prices There is much wisdom invested in the Constitution of this country and its other laws However when we allow things to get out of control and fail to obey the laws in accordance with the mind of the founding fathers of our country there will be trouble all over But when the rule of law prevails we recover from setbacks there will be progress and peace Todays readings deal with laws especially the First Reading Ex 20117 and the Gospel Jn 21325 We must be very careful not to regard the Commandments of God as mere civil laws Gods laws are laws of love As a loving Father he gave us only 10 Commandments How many laws are there in the Nations Constitution There are many of them In the Code of Canon Law the law of the Church how many are they There are 1752 laws They are for the salvation of souls You see In the 10 Commandments of God the first 3 go directly to God and the remaining 7 go directly to us and our neighbors and then indirectly to God Of the first 3 Commandments that go directly to God the 3rd one is Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day The Jew ish Sabbath is now the Christian Sunday We are obliged to keep Sunday holy God said Six days you may labor and do all your work but on the seventh day Sunday is holy to the Lord your God No work may be done neither you or your son or your daughter or your slave or your beast or by the alien who lives with you You keep Sunday holy by 1 Attend Mass go to Church 2 Do not work especially manual work 3 Pray more read your Bible more and Catholic books on Sunday There are 7 days in a week God is so generous to allow us to do work in 6 days and kept only one day for himself Think about this his generosity If we break this Com mandment it will be too difficult for us to explain to God why we could not keep holy the Lords Day What the breaking of some of the civil law does in society chaotic situation is likened to what breaking of Gods law does in our spiritual life chaotic spiritual catastrophe Breaking of law causes disorder That was why in the Gos pel Jn 21325 The Lord Jesus was angry with those who turn Gods house into a marketplace They are not law abiding You are Gods house you must keep it holy Let us make sincere effort to keep Gods lovingly Commandments for their keeping is for our good the salvation of our souls God bless you Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 Dear Parents
