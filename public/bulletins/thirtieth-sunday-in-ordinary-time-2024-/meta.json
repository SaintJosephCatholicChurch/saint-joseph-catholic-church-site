27th the Church celebrates the Thirtieth Sunday in Ordinary Time As we near the end of the liturgical year ending after the Thirty fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time our focus begins to turn towards heavenly things Though our readings seem on the surface to be about physical sight on a deeper level they instead remind us to see things through the eyes of God and focus on our true end Heaven Theology on Tap Angels and Demons Join us this Tuesday October 29th at 6:30PM for our next Theology on Tap at Parlor City Brewery 212 Market St Bluffton This event is open to all 21 as we delve into the roles these spiritual beings play in our faith and lives their influences purposes and the profound truths they reveal about Gods creation Food and drink will be available for purchase at the Brewery Solemnity of All Saints Holy Day of Obligation This Friday November 1st the Church celebrates the Solemnity of All Saints a Holy Day of Obligation This celebration is rooted in the Feast of All Martyrs celebrated among many eastern Churches at the beginning of the 4th Century Gaining popularity in the West at the beginning of the 7th Century it was added to the universal liturgical calendar in the 9th Century To aide in our obligation to assist at Mass for this holy day we are offering four different Mass times All Saints Day Vigil Mass Thursday Oct 31st at 7:00pm All Saints Day Mass Friday Nov 1st at 7:00am 12:00pm 5:30pm Following the 5:30pm Mass you are invited to join us for our annual All Saints Day Party in the Parish Social Hall Come dressed as your favorite Saint for a time of parish fellowship and fraternity Commemoration of All Souls Blessing of an Altar On Saturday November 2nd we will have a special 5:00PM Mass for the Commemoration of All Souls at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery At this Mass we will bless and for the first time offer Mass on the recently installed cemetery altar The blessing of an altar is itself a fairly rare occasion often occurring only with the dedication of a new church building or chapel Utilizing the imagery of St John from the Book of Revelation our cemetery altar serves as a reminder of our hope in the resurrection Just as our Saviour appears as the Lamb who has been sacrificed and whose offering is taken by the angels to the altar in heaven Revelation 56 so we pray and hope that our loved ones will likewise be raised from their tombs to that same altar in heaven joining the Saints and angels in the praise of God for all eternity I invite our whole parish family to join us next Saturday evening at the cemetery for this outdoor Mass and historic event in the life of our parish Note This evening Mass does count for our Sunday obligation For those who cannot join us Saturday evening at the cemetery Fr Bill Sullivan will be offering our regular Saturday vigil Mass at the Church Liturgy of the Eucharist Holy Holy Holy After the Preface we join the angelic choirs in praying the Holy Holy Holy This unending hymn of angelic praise reflects both Isaiah's vision of God in the vision of a king in a majestic throne Isaiah 61 4 and St John's vision of the six winged angelic creatures before the throne of God singing such praise Revelations 48 Other words in the Holy Holy Holy like Hosanna and Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord are also expressions of biblical origin These words can be found in Psalm 118 and were the phrases with which the crowds greeted Jesus as He processed into the city of Jerusalem on Palm Sunday It's so apt to sing the Holy Holy Holy at this point of the Mass Just as the crowds welcomed Jesus into Jerusalem with the phrases from Psalm 118 we too welcome Jesus as He becomes present to us in the Holy Eucharist Weekend of November 2nd 3rd 500 David Smith 730 Mike
