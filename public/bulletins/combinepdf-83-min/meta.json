have entered back into Ordinary Time we still have several major celebrations before we return to a green Sunday in the second weekend of June Transitioning from the joy of Pentecost and acknowledging the coming of the Holy Spirit we now see how we ourselves are called into and participate in the divine life of the Most Holy Trinity The Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity reminds us that through Jesus Christ the divine life of the Most Holy Trinity has been revealed and made accessible to us And we in turn are now invited to share in this life for all eternity We have been adopted by the Father are brethren and joint heirs of the Son and have the Holy Spirit dwelling within us Truly our very lives are meant to be fully immersed in the divine love that is God This divine life is nourished in us now for a time through reception of the Most Holy Eucharist For this reason our liturgical calendar moves from the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity to the Solemnity of Corpus Christi next weekend In the Eucharist we receive the Lord in a unique and intimate way In the words of the 20th Century martyr St Maximilian Kolbe the Eucharist should transform our hearts into a fire of love and gratitude Corpus Christi Procession Join us next Sunday immediately following the 10 AM Sunday Mass for our Corpus Christi Eucharistic Procession This procession is scheduled to take us off campus and into our local community The full route is only 06 miles but will still have three stops or stations along the way as we bring our Lord into the streets hear from the Sacred Scriptures and pray for those in need At the end of the procession you are invited to stay for an informal ice cream social and visit with fellow parishioners We are also planning to have a few cars available to taxi those who walked back to the parish parking lot As this is the first time in recent memory that our procession will go off campus I encourage you to consider joining in the procession Our very presence in the procession will be a powerful witness to our belief in the Holy Eucharist St Francis Summer Reading Program Starting the second weekend of June we will begin our annual St Francis Summer Reading Program This summer program invites our youth and young parishioners to read a variety of faith based books throughout the summer and the opportunity to receive prizes based on the number of pages and books read We are in need of volunteers to help with running the prize table for our youth and checking books in and out after each weekend Mass If you would be willing to volunteer after the weekend Mass you attend please see the sign up sheets in the narthex Priesthood Ordinations Next Saturday June 1st at 11 AM Bishop Rhoades will ordain Deacon Caleb Kruse and Deacon Oscar Duarte to the priesthood at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Fort Wayne This event is open to the public As a priestly ordination Mass is unlike any other event that you will attend I would encourage you to consider attending and supporting our newly ordained with your prayers With only two being ordained this year there should be space available in the Cathedral for a number of the Faithful to attend Memorial Day Mass This Monday May 27th we will have a special morning Mass at 9:00AM for the Memorial Day Holiday As a nation Memorial Day serves as a day in which we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives in defense of our country May we begin the day together united in prayer for our fallen loved ones and all those who have given their lives for our nation Faithfully in Christ Fr David PARISH CALENDAR Sat May 25 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sun May 26 Mass 7:30am Mass 10:00am Mon May 27 Mass 9:00am for Memorial Day Mon May 27 Memorial
