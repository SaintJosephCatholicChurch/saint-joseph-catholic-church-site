Lent And so begins our Lenten journey The celebration of Lent itself dates back to at least the Council of Nicaea in AD 325 though the practice of fasting in preparation for Easter finds its roots in the Apostolic Age This was initially asked only of those desiring to enter into the Church each year but over time this period of preparation for Easter Sunday was adopted for the benefit and at the request of the Faithful The Seven Last Words Starting Tuesday at 6 PM First popularized in the 17th Century Lent would rarely pass by without parishes offering a special devotion to The Seven Last Words This devotion reflects upon the seven final words or sayings of Jesus from upon the Cross as recorded in the Sacred Scriptures These seven sayings focus on themes of Forgiveness Salvation Relationship Abandonment Distress Triumph and Reunion In them we are able to join our Lord at the foot of the Cross We will be reviving this devotion on Tuesdays over the next several weeks of Lent in the Parish Conference Room Joining with Dr Scott Hahn from the St Paul Center and the Floriani Music Society we will weekly engage with a beautifully produced reflection into the love our Savior as revealed on the Cross After the reflection we will have a time for discussion and prayer Our first evening of reflection is this Tuesday Mar 11th from 6 7:00PM in the Parish Conference Room We will focus on the first of the seven last words Father forgive them for they know not what they do Luke 2334 The Light Is On For You This week our parish will join parishes throughout our diocese for the annual The Light Is On For You Campaign On Tuesday March 11th every parish in our diocese will be offering Confessions from 600 8:00PM special Thank you to Fr Bill Sullivan who will be hearing confessions for us during this time Reminder Our weekly Confession times are Tues from 830 9:00AM Wed 6 6:45PM and Sat 830 9:00AM and 4 4:45PM Praise and Worship Holy Hour This Wednesday March 12th our normal 600 7:00PM Holy Hour will be a special Praise and Worship Holy Hour led by our Youth Group Following the great experience that many of our youth had at Camp Damascus this past summer several have volunteered to help lead music for a monthly holy hour special Thank You to Nick our Engagement Director for helping to organize this effort on behalf of our youth Mass Settings Mass of Our Lady As part of our parish's preparation for Easter we will be learning a new Mass Setting throughout Lent for use in the Easter Season Mass Setting are the sung parts of the Mass often sung using the same tune so as to express the unity of the whole liturgy from beginning to end To introduce this new setting we will sing through a different part before Mass each weekend during Lent By Easter Sunday we will have sung the entire setting This new Mass Setting is called The Mass of Our Lady It was written by Steve Warner and Karen Schneider Kirner whom composed the setting together in 2012 while co leading the Notre Dame Folk Choir in South Bend Given this connection to Notre Dame the setting is already widely used in parishes throughout the South Bend side of our diocese and has continued to spread to parishes in the Fort Wayne side over the years This has been a setting that I had hoped we'd introduce to our parish for some time both due to its familiarity in parishes throughout our diocese and its beautiful simplicity The tune itself is very joyous and uplifting and musically very accessible to all myself included Sadly due to differing publishing houses this setting is not in our hymnals As such we ll include a printed insert with the Mass Setting within our hymnals come Easter Weekend of March 15th 16th 500 David Smith 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Jay
