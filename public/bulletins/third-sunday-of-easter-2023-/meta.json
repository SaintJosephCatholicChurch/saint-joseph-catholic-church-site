  "text": "Third Sunday of Easter April 23 2023 This weekend April 22nd23rd the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Easter As we are not yet even at the halfway point of the Easter season our celebration is meant to continue for several more weeks As much as we are called to celebrate these many weeks we might begin to grow weary of this celebration To remain in Easter joy can become quite tiring as we face the trials and struggles of everyday life As we continue in Eastertide we remember Pope St John Paul II's remark that our celebration of the Resurrection does not remove the sadness and sin of our world It does however make us an Easter People and Hallelujah is our song During these fifty days celebrating the Resurrection we are invited to deepen our faith and increase our trust in the Risen Lord Himself If we are willing to share in His daily death to self we too can share in the joy of His rising everyday of our life World Day of Prayer for Vocations This past week I spent four days in Emmitsburg Maryland at Mount St Mary's Seminary These days offered a wonderful opportunity to visit with our thirteen diocesan seminarians studying for the priesthood We have another four men studying at the North American College in Rome I am always edified when spending time with these young men as they prepare to serve our local Church This coming June 3rd seven of these men will be ordained as priests for our diocese and be assigned as associate pastors in our various parishes Next year we will have for the first time in nearly a decade just over ten men studying for the priesthood in our diocese often having twenty to thirty Though this number often rises and falls it is a good reminder of our need to constantly pray for vocations In our parish we are blessed to have many couples entering into the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony with four couples approaching the Sacrament this year We also want to continue our prayers for men and women from our parish to discern vocations in both priestly and religious life something we pray for every weekend in our Vocation Prayer All three of these vocations Marriage Priesthood and Religious Life are vocations of service In them we serve the Lord through our daily lives lived for our spouses and children or the Church and Her people Next weekend the latter two vocations are highlighted as we celebrate the Fourth Sunday of Easter also known as the World Day of Prayer for Vocations Instituted by Pope St Paul VI in 1964 this day of prayer falls every year as we hear the Gospel reading of the Good Shepherd It is a good reminder to not only pray for but to actively encourage and welcome vocations to grow from within our own community Ecce Young Adult Choir Concert Next Sunday April 30th we are privileged to host the Ecce Young Adult Choir from Fort Wayne at 1 PM for an afternoon Easter concert I hope that you will take advantage of this opportunity to enjoy a beautiful musical afternoon concert this Easter season In addition to the concert the Ecce Young Adult Choir will also be joining us for and providing music at our 10 AM Mass next Sunday in anticipation of their concert later that afternoon Join us for a potluck pitch in after Mass and before the concert in the Parish Social Hall for some parish fraternity and a chance to meet the members of the Ecce Young Adult Choir All are welcome Name That Bell Voting Next weekend we will have a special insert listing the four Saint finalists for our Name That Bell Contest With over 30 suggestions we will narrow the list down to four names and provide a brief background of each Saint You will then be invited to vote for your favorite choice over the remainder of the Easter season The winning Saint name will be engraved upon the face of the bell before it is returned to our campus and dedicated this coming summer Faithfully in the Risen Lord Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday April 22 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am Confession 400 4:45pm
