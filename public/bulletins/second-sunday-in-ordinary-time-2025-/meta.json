Time January 19 2025 This weekend January 18th 19th the Church celebrates the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time Immediately following the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord we entered into this new season of Ordinary Time last Monday and will remain in it until the beginning of Lent on Ash Wednesday March 5th We will however continue to experience brief glimpses of Christmastide joy over the next few weeks One such glimpse is found in this weekend's Gospel reading The Wedding Feast of Cana This reading serves as the last of the three epiphany events each of which reveal Jesus divinity from our celebration of the Epiphany two weekends ago These glimpses will continue through till the fortieth day of Christmas February 2nd when we celebrate the Presentation of the Lord in the Temple These brief moments of Christmastide joy are meant to extend the joy of the Incarnation in our lives Jesus has become man for our sake and our salvation The manifestations of His glory continue in this day through His Mystical Body which is the Church Each of us through our baptism participate in His Mystical Body As we hear in our second reading today to each individual the manifestation of the Spirit is given for some benefit 1 Corinthians 127 This means that God is still at work in the world today He is at work in it through His Church through us We are called to be His hands and feet that are reaching out to those in need The different spiritual gifts which have been entrusted to us for service to the Church are meant to aid us in building up the Body of Christ Let us open our hearts to these different spiritual gifts and ask the Holy Spirit to reveal them in our lives so that might put them to use General Campus Upkeep You may have noticed that the tree between the rectory and the Church was recently taken down Over the past several years a number of large branches dropped during storms have fallen dangerously close to both the Church and rectory In one instance a falling branch struck the rectory but thankfully caused minimal damage Given this potential danger and at the suggestion of our grounds crew it was decided that the tree needed to be removed After the tree was felled it was bucked and stacked out back alongside the road behind the Church If anyone is in need of firewood you are welcome to come and take as much as you need from this pile of stacked logs until the wood is gone Adult Confirmations June 8th Later this summer Bishop Rhoades will be hosting a special Mass for adults who have not yet received the Sacrament of Confirmation This Mass is open to all Catholics 18 who desire to receive the Sacrament of Confirmation but have not yet been able to do so If you would like to receive this wonderful Sacrament at this special Mass with Bishop Rhoades please let me know by either email or contacting the Parish Office The Jubilee Year Year of Hope Just as we are celebrating our parish's 150th anniversary this year so the whole Church throughout the world is celebrating the Jubilee Year of Hope jubilee year is traditionally celebrated every 25 years though can occur more frequently such as the Jubilee Year of Mercy in 2016 These special celebrations are meant to invoke a year of grace and celebration often given a specific spiritual focus for that year As we near the 2000th anniversary of the Crucifixion this jubilee year has been given the theme of Hope This invites us to focus on the hope that the Gospel brings to the world particularly in times of crisis and uncertainty The Jubilee Year is marked with the opening of the Holy Doors which are a symbol of Christ's open invitation to all The Holy Doors are those designated by each Bishop in their respective dioceses Bishop Rhoades has marked nine sets of doors as Holy Doors in our diocese See the bulletin cover for more Weekend of January 25th 26th 500 Teresa Smith 730 David Smith 1000 Jay Crisp 500 Dan Geimer 730 Carol Butler 1000 Patti Clark Johnson 500 Laurisa
