  "text": "IXTEENTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME July 19 2020 This weekend July 18th19th the Church enters into the 16th Sunday in Or dinary And in our Gospel reading we continue to hear from the third great dis course of our blessed Lord in St Matthews Gospel Within St Matthews Gos pel our blessed Lord offers five discourses or sermons including The Sermon on the Mount Matthew 57 Instructions for the Missionary Life Matthew 10 the Collection of Parables Matthew 13 Instructions for Communal Living Matthew 18 and the Sermon on the End Times Matthew 2325 In these discourses our blessed Lord imparts great wisdom to His disciples regarding the moral life He explains how to go about spreading the Gospel and He prepares His disciples for life in the Church and eventually in the world to come The third discourse on the collection of parables which we began last weekend speaks to several parables that offer insight into the Kingdom of Heaven In our Gospel reading today Matthew132443 Jesus tells the par ables of the wheat and the weeds the mustard seed and yeast mixed with flour In the last two parables that we heard today of the mustard seed and the yeast both of which are also found in the Gospels of St Mark and St Luke our blessed Lord emphasizes how small things can become great things Just as the mustard seed grows into a great bush and a little yeast can leaven the whole dough so the smallest amount of faith can change the world When we allow God into our lives even in the smallest of ways everything changes The first parable that of the wheat and weeds is exclusive to St Matthews Gospel In it the enemy sows weeds among the wheat and the two cannot be separated until harvest time arrives They cannot be separated because they are not immediately distinguishable in the field and when they mature enough to tell the difference their roots are intertwined The weeds are at first indistin guishable from the wheat This reveals to us a simple truth Sin is boring Sin is boring Why is it boring Because sin like the devil himself is not and cannot be creative Only love and God is love 1 John 48 is creative When we fall into sin it is because we are seeking after something that we love But in our sinfulness we try to obtain it in the wrong way and through the wrong means Everything on earth is meant to direct us to God That is the proper end telos of every action Sin stops actions short of God This is why sin never satisfies the human heart To quote St Augustine in the 4th Century Our hearts are restless until they rest in God Why is this Be cause we have been made by and for God Or to put it simply Why do we ex ist To know love and serve God Anything else leaves our hearts wanting be cause only God will satisfy that longing In the end the weeds will be burned away and the wheat will remain At the end of our lives only that which was rooted in God will remain May we dare to be creative today May we dare to love May we be courageous and live for God As we begin to prepare for the coming Fall we are gearing up to resume our inperson Religious Education classes on Sunday September 13th As in previ ous years our K8th Grade Classes and Youth

our insurance agent Catholic Mutual was on campus to review the roofs on our buildings Due to the recent storms and high winds he saw signs of storm damage While this has not affected the inte rior of our buildings yet it is a matter we will want to address to ensure the up keep of our Church and our other buildings As my first pastor taught me Preventative maintenance is the best kind of maintenance Once we receive the adjusters report I will be reaching out to our Building Board Parish Council and Finance Council to see how we as a parish want to proceed with this nec essary upkeep
