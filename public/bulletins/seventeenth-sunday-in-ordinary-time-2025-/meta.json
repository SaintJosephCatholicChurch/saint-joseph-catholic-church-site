celebrates the Seventeenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Following last weekend our Gospel focuses on the love of God through the powerful theme of persistence in prayer Jesus not only teaches His disciples the Our Father a prayer rooted in trust praise and surrender but also encourages them to pray with perseverance and confidence Utilizing the parable of the friend knocking at midnight the Lord reminds us that He desires that we come to Him continually In doing so we are called to bring our needs hopes and struggles to Him without losing heart Placing all these things at His feet prayer gently draws our hearts into harmony with His divine will As we surrender our deepest desires into His loving hands our hearts are slowly shaped to beat in unison with His own This week may we consider the areas in our lives that require persistent prayer whether it's with our family work health or important decisions Like St Monica who prayed tirelessly for decades for the conversion of her son St Augustine we are invited to pray without ceasing No matter what we face may we pray consistently and persistently Don't give up and dont be afraid Keep praying with great tenacity and boldness Update on Church Renovations This past Monday I sat down with Bill Heyer and his architectural team We reviewed and have now approved the bid set being prepared for con struction drawings These drawings contain much of the technical work pre pared by a team of architects that will actually guide the contractors in their work This bid set will be sent to the three firms that will be bidding to serve as our primary contractor for renovations Once sent out there will be a three week bid window where each contrac tor will have the chance to ask questions regarding the project and submit their bid for our review Once the three bids are returned we will review them with the Diocesan Finance Council The council's guidance will help us in deter mining which contractor to work with Once this is decided we will be able to begin setting a timetable for the renovation work Discover Catholicism Over the past many weeks we've had a number of inquiries from those interested in learning more about the Faith or even becoming Catholic Our Discover Catholicism program will begin on Thursday September 4th at 6:30PM in the Parish Conference Room for all those interested in encountering or learning more about the Faith I encourage you to consider joining us for these evenings and inviting others to do so as well This weekly program is an open forum walk through of the basics of Catholicism starting first with a look at the Creed Each week we will move through the various elements of the Creed one of the most basic proclamations of the Faith leaving much time for questions and discussion This allows for a no pressure environment where participants are invited to freely explore what the Church teaches and why This weekly gatheringis perfect for those returning to the Church exploring the Faith for the first time or simply curious All are welcome As mentioned in the homily there are informational cards available in the Narthex with details about this program I encourage you to take at least one of these cards with you and personally invite someone to join us Your invitation might be the very moment the Lord uses to touch a heart and change a life Blessed Solanus Casey On Wednesday July 30th our diocese will be one of only a handful in the world that will celebrates the feast day of Bl Solanus Casey As this humble Franciscan friar lived at St Felix Friary in nearby Huntington from 1946 to

href=\"tel:(260)296-0511\">(260)296-0511</a> Blessed Solanus Casey OFM Cap Servant of the sick and the poor Fr Solanus Casey was born on a farm in 1870 to an Irish immigrant family of Oak Grove WI He was given the name Bernard Francis and was the sixth of Bernard and Ellen Caseys sixteen children They were Catholics of a deep and simple faith a faith that would animate him all 87 years of his life At the age of 17 he left the farm to take a series of jobs lumberjack hospital orderly prison guard street car operator to help the family back home One day while driving the street car he witnessed a brutal murder that led him to re evaluate what he should do with his life He resolved to dedicate his life to a steadfast and enduring ministry of bringing God's care to this hurting world He would become a priest Although past the age to enter minor seminary he was permitted to begin his studies there because of his very limited education Classes were taught however in German and Latin neither of which he could speak or read and he was soon advised to leave and join a religious order In December of 1897 he entered the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in Detroit There he was given the name Solanus after St Francis Solanus Professed into the Order in July of 1898 he was ordained to the priesthood in 1904 As he had not performed well in his studies however he was limited in what he could do He was assigned as a simplex priest one who could preside at Mass but could not preach publicly or hear confessions He accepted this decision as Gods will and never questioned it Following ordination he was immediately transferred to a busy friary in Yonkers NY He was assigned to care for the sacristy train the altar boys and answer the front door It was that position as doorkeeper or porter that would be a defining character of Fr Solanus ministry throughout his life His simple trust in God his certainty that every prayer is answered in Gods own way his gentle listening to each person who came whether Catholic or non Catholic led to his quickly becoming known wherever he was assigned His heart went out to all He would listen pray with them suggest some work they could do for others as a way to thank God ahead of time for His help Like Jesus he saw each person as an individual loved by God and called to share in God's life for all eternity The Life of Blessed Solanus Casey Nov 25 1870 Born as Bernard Francis Casey in Oak Grove Wisconsin he was one of ten boys and six girls His parents were Irish Catholic immigrants who had come to America following the Great Famine of Ireland in the 1850s 1873 The Casey family moved to a larger farm in Wisconsin He and his siblings enjoyed fishing swimming skiing and skating But Bernard nicknamed Barney at the time didnt like boxing because inflicting pain on another person was not aligned with his values 1878 When he was 8 years old Bernard contracted diphtheria which had already led to the death of two of his siblings Though he recovered he was left with a speech impediment 1883 At the age of 12 Bernard spent time at St Patrick's Catholic Church in Hudson Wisconsin receiving lessons for his first Holy Communion It was during this time that he first felt called to be a priest He spent the next several years however in a variety of jobs including lumberjack street car operator prison guard and hospital orderly 1892 At the age of 21 Bernard entered St Francis Seminary in Milwaukee 1896 Bernard faced great difficulty in his studies at the seminary Eventually it was recommended that he consider entering religious life Discerning this call he said he heard the Blessed Mother tell him Go to Detroit where the Capuchin Friars were based 1897 Invested as a Capuchin Novice Bernard received the name Francis Solanus after the 17th Century saint St Francis Solanus Both he and his namesake loved to play the violin 1904 After making vows as a Capuchin Friar Solanus was ordained as a priest Due to his limited studies in seminary he was assigned to serve as a simplex priest meaning that he could not preach formal sermons or hear confessions 1904 21 Fr Solanus served at several churches in New York in Yonkers and New York City where he drew crowds seeking his prayerful advice and spiritual blessings 1924 45 Fr Solanus arrived at St Bonaventure Monastery in Detroit where he would serve for 20 years as the monastery's porter On Wednesday afternoons he conducted services for sick people offering them his priestly blessing Many claimed to have been cured by him November 2 1929 As the Great Depression struck Fr Solanus helped start the Capuchin Soup Kitchen in Detroit As unemployed workers came to the Friary begging for food they encountered Fr Solanus who greeted them with large sandwiches and cups of coffee 1946 1956 As Fr Solanus health began to decline he was sent to St Felix Friary in Huntington Indiana to rest and recover There he once again served as the monastery's porter greeting all those who came to the monastery and local chapel July 31 1957 Having returned to Detroit in 1956 as his health worsened Fr Solanus was admitted to St John's Hospital following an infection in July of 1957 He passed away peacefully at the hospital at the age of 86 after softly speaking his final words to his fellow friars surrounding his hospital bed I give my soul to Jesus Christ July 11 1995 Fr Solanus was declared Venerable by Pope John Paul II November 18 2017 Blessed Solanus Casey was beatified by Pope Francis Knights of Columbus Father Aloysius Phillips Council
