  "text": "Twenty Seventh Sunday in Ordinary Time October 2 2022 This weekend October 1st 2nd the Church celebrates the Twenty seventh Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings take up the theme of faith both of Israel's faith under the Old Covenant and the faith to which we are called in the New Covenant Jesus urges us not to despair even if we feel that our faith is insufficient As seen in the Parable of the Mustard Seed God can work wonders using even the smallest of things Next weekend we will kick off the 36th Annual Bishop's Appeal ABA at all Masses In previous years this included a showing of the ABA video This year the video is available online and can be viewed through our parish website Pledge cards have already been sent to all registered households Extra pledge cards available in the narthex Thank you for returning your pledge card either by mail or in the collection basket and helping our parish reach 100 participation This year's ABA theme is The Eucharist Sacrament of Charity As we enter into these three years of Eucharistic Revival this theme reminds us of how in the words of the Second Vatican Council the Eucharistic sacrifice is the summit toward which all the activity of the church is directed With this understanding any funds that exceed our parish goal and returns to our parish will go towards the building of an altar at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery The Eucharistic sacrifice offered upon this altar will serve as a powerful witness of both our hope of the resurrection and the union of the Church In the Eucharist we are united together as the Church on earth in purgation and in heaven as we worship before the throne of God With the placement of an altar at the cemetery we are given a visible reminder of how we remain united with our dearly departed loved ones through prayer Bible Study Study in Typology Our most signed up for group throughout our Registration Ministry Weekend was for those interested in joining a Bible study After much prayer over what book of the Bible to study I felt it would be best to look at all of them Instead of walking through a singular book as we have done in the past our Bible study this year will focus on the topic of typology Typology is our way of looking at the Old Testament through the lens of the New and understanding the New in the fulfillment of the Old For example we see a type of Jesus in Adam St Paul identifies this in 1 Corinthians 1522 stating that just as in Adam all die so too in Christ shall all be brought to life Through Adam the first man death enters the world Through Jesus the new man death is defeated This is just one of many types we will see Our first meeting for Study in Typology will be offered on Thursday October 27th at 7:30PM in the Parish Social Hall Each meeting will plan to run for one hour Starting in November we will plan to meet twice a month Did You Know Dressing the Chalice Our bulletin cover this weekend describes the different items that can be used to dress or prepare the chalice for Mass Each item often has both a practical and spiritual purpose Even the material itself used for these items have meaning Anything that holds the Body or Blood of our Lord the Chalice and Paten are made of precious materials as the Eucharist is the most precious thing on earth The use of fine linen in both the purificator and the corporal should be reminiscent of the fine linen cloths used to wrap the body of our Lord for burial cf Matthew 2759 The Chalice Veil and Burse are to match the priest's vestments showing the connection between the priest who offers sacrifice and the instruments that are to be used in that same sacrifice These items though often left unexplained stand as silent witnesses to our Faith Everything in the liturgy has a purpose and that purpose is to proclaim the Good News Jesus Christ is risen from the dead As in liturgy so in life Everything we do and everything about us is to proclaim Jesus MASS INTENTIONS
