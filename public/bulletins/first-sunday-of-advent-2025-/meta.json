Sunday of Advent November 30 2025 Happy Liturgical New Year This weekend Nov 29th 30th the Church celebrates the First Sunday of Advent During this season we look back with gratitude to Bethlehem and forward with hope to Christ's return in glory This season its roots reaching back to at least the 4th Century serves as a time for prayer and fasting in preparation for the coming adventus of Christmas Day This season was often referred to as little Lent and ranged anywhere from three to six weeks depending on the local custom It has held to the four week structure that we know today since the 9th Century Overall the purpose of this preparatory and penitential season is to open our hearts to the Lord who has come into the world Or in the thought of St Augustine of Hippo To love His first coming so that we may be ready to rejoice at His second coming Advent invites us to a daily discipline of silence to hear the voice of God in our hearts These words of Pope St John Paul II highlight one of the ways we can best enter into the Advent season Going against the busyness and noise of the world we embrace the silence that will lead us into that holy and quiet night on which Christ was born In silence and stillness we open our hearts to hear the voice of the Christ child calling out to us Liturgically we embrace this call to silence by inviting more silence into our liturgy Throughout Advent the Gloria is not intoned or prayed save for solemnities This hymn of praise will not spring forth from our lips until we join our song with that of the angelic choir that first proclaimed Glory to God to the shepherds Likewise our closing hymn will give way to silence to reflect that quiet anticipation and longing of the heart for the Christ child Similarly with the new liturgical year we have now completed praying our Parish 150th Anniversary Prayer before each Mass We will now take those few moments before Mass as a time for recollection Likewise we will conclude our Communion Hymn at the reposition of the Most Holy Eucharist after the distribution of Holy Communion The purification of the vessels will take place in silence to allow for a few extra moments of quiet contemplation Our liturgical accoutrements also take on a more silent nature as well Our gilded candlesticks and altar crucifix are switched for their wooden replacements The wood lacks that luster of the more precious metals Similarly the bleached candles are replaced with unbleached beeswax These elements provide a visual silence that is muted in color humble in appearance and reminiscent of the simplicity of Bethlehem Annual Advent Baby Shower In preparation for the coming of the Christ child we will once again have the opportunity of helping families in need Please see the included insert in this weekend's bulletin for our annual Advent Baby Shower supporting the needs of Helping Hands one of our local pregnancy and family resource centers Thank you for your generosity to this good cause Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception Holy Day of Obligation As a reminder the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception a holy day of obligation is quickly approaching In 1846 the Sixth Provincial Council of Baltimore dedicated our nation on its seventieth anniversary under the protec tion of the Blessed Virgin Mary through the title of the Immaculate Concep tion

the Mass for this holy day we will offer four Masses for the Holy Day There will be a Vigil Mass on Sunday December 7th at 5 PM and Masses on Monday December 8th at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM Please Note We
