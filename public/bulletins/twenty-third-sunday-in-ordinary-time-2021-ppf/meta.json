  "text": "WENTY HIRD UNDAY I RDINARY IME EPTEMBER 5 2021 This weekend September 4th5th the Church celebrates the Twenty third Sunday in Ordinary Time In our Gospel Mark 73137 we hear of Jesus continued healing ministry This word Ephphatha used today is also used in our baptismal liturgy After an individual has been baptized the celebrant touches their ears and mouth praying that the newly baptized may hear Gods word and loudly proclaim it Just as the man miraculously healed in todays Gospel is changed so we are changed in baptism Through baptism the Holy Spirit produces in our souls in the supernatural order effects comparable to those which Christ produces in the body of the deaf and mute man Once we pass through these saving waters we are freed from Original Sin our bodies become temples of the Holy Spirit our souls are forever marked for Christ and our hearts are open to receive His saving words Each of then is called to preach the good news In baptism we have first encountered Christ This encounter is never meant to end Our relationship with Jesus Christ is only meant to grow and deepen What is started through the waters of baptism is meant to continue to wellup and to flourish even unto the Kingdom of Heaven APTISMAL ONT PDATE Several weeks ago our baptismal font was taken in for restoration and renovation As we have been able to trace this same font back to the old church on Cherry Street it has seen many years of wear and tear Partnering with Mazzolini Artcraft work on the font is underway Of initial concern was a prominent crack in the baptismal bowl itself but this has been able to be safely repaired The interior of the bowl is being given a tiledinsert pictured and will be sealed so as to prevent any water damage moving forward special Thank You to our GIRLs Night Out whose fundraising efforts made this repair and renovation possible Because of this this font will continue to serve our parish for years to come HILDREN HOIR DULT HOR As
