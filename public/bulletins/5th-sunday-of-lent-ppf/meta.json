23149 FIFTH SUNDAY OF LENT APRIL 7 2019 As we entered into the church today we should have immediately sensed that some thing was different This yearly veiling of our statues and devotional images serves as a visual reminder that we are now entering into the last two weeks of Lent often called Passiontide During this time we focus our minds and hearts ever more closely on the bitter Passion and death of our Lord so that we might meditate upon the great sacrifice that He has undertaken for each and every one of us This focus will be guided even deeper as we hear and prayerfully contemplate the narrative of the Lords Passion next weekend on Palm Sunday Prior to hearing the narrative of the Lords Passion Luke 22142356 at the Gospel we will first hear the Gospel account of the Lord entering into Jerusalem Luke 192840 as we begin Mass At our 5 PM Vigil and 7:30AM Morning Masses this first Gospel will be read from the back of the church immediately prior to our entrance hymn At our Sunday 10 AM Mass we will start our Palm Sunday celebra tion with an outdoor procession into the church weather permitting To participate in the procession please gather outside the main entrance to the Parish Offices starting at 9:40AM We will begin the reading of the first Gospel at 9:45AM and will then process into the church Please note Incense will be used at the 10 AM Mass The Palm Sunday Procession is itself an ancient practice first recorded by the pilgrim Etheria in her 4th Century letter Pilgrimage to the Holy Lands Etheria recounts this already established tradition of a procession led by the local bishop with palm branches from the Mount of Olives to Jerusalem to begin Holy Week Fol lowing after this ancient tradition we too will join with the Church in procession During the procession we will see the priest make use of two liturgical vestments that we do not see that often a red cope and a biretta The cope is a cloak worn by the priest in liturgical functions outside of Mass such as Stations of the Cross the biretta is a hat worn by the priest when in procession Just as quickly as both items will appear in the procession they will also van ish Before entering the sanctuary the priest removes the biretta leaving his head bare and upon reaching the chair the cope is exchanged for the chasuble the priestly garment worn at Mass These two vestments serve to distinguish between the proces sion from the world and the heavenly Mass that the procession leads us to Removing them as we prepare to enter into the Mass also serves as a visible reminder that as each of us processes from the world towards the altar of God we are called to humble ourselves and lay our hearts bare before the Father Those things in our lives that we wear to cover our hearts are stripped away as God sees us for whom we truly are Parish Updates During the summer we hope to bring to completion our Parking Lot Project Working with Brooks Construction Company the parking lot will be renovated over two weeks in July The work will be focused during the weekdays which should pre vent any disturbances to our weekend Mass schedule This repair to our parking lot is necessary and will help ensure its sustainability for the years to come The project expenses will be slightly over 60000 much of which will come from our Rainy Day Fund Your continued support of this collection at the first of the month helps to en sure the upkeep of our beautiful campus for our future generations We are continuing to work with Dunwiddie Heating and the Root Candle Company to determine the source of the discoloration along the north church wall While there are several possible sources one we have been looking at is soot pro duced by candles After an extended period we have noticed that every so often our oil candles will give off soot while burning We have not seen this from our wax can dles Therefore as a precaution and at the suggestion of our candle supplier we will be replacing the oil candles used on the altars with wax candles in the coming weeks Our candlesticks will not change as they fit either oil or wax candles and we will properly store the oil candles so that if deemed safe we can make use of them in the future Finally as a reminder I will be away from our parish for the months of June and July Bishop Rhoades has asked that I pursue further studies at the Catholic Uni versity of America in Washington DC While the majority of my coursework will be completed online I will need to be present on campus for classes through June and July over the next several years We will be welcoming priests throughout the summer who will be assisting at St Josephs during my absence More information to come as we draw closer to the summer months WEEKEND OF APRIL
