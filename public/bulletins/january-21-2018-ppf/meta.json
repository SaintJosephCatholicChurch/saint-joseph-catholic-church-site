THIRD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR HOMILY THEME JESUS SAID TO THEM FOLLOW ME AND IMME DIATELY THEY FOLLOWED HIM Mark 11718 BY Fr Robert deLeon CSC HOMILY Mark 11420 Why did he pick me Was it because most of the others nearby were young nurses scurrying to clockin for work Was it because I was the only older person in sight not wheelchairbound or unsteadily maneuvering a walker Was it because of the Roman collar I was wearing Or maybe it was because I was traveling against the flow of traffic The bright June morning found mobs of us crossing the walkway bridge adjoining the hospital to the parking garage Throngs of nurses in a bright array of scrubs dashed past me the urgency of punching in on time a clear reversal of the sauntering casual chatter that marked their exit at end of shift Pressed for time these nurses mostly female dodged wheelchairs and zigzagged around anxious elders anchored to walk ers Yes they were all in a nearrun to the time clock as hospital duties called insis tently Already at the hospital for several hours ahead of the stampede I was struggling against the flow returning to my car to retrieve a forgotten item as the horde contin ued past Drowsy smiles and hurried salutations were hurled at me as they zipped by I barely noticed the figure caught in the traffic flow until he was upon me In conser vative suit and tie near desperation on his face he broke from the rush to address me Please can you help me Both of us now pressed against the walkway windows as the pack passed I was quick to respond Sure Ill help you if I can What do you need He pleaded I have a medical school interview here in 10 minutes and I cant button the top button of my shirt Can you do it for me I laughed Yes I just laughed Here in this place where life and death daily dueled this young mans concernthis wouldbe doctors present careseemed so innocent childlike Buttoning his top button and straighten ing his tie I wished him well as he dashed off to his appointment Could he have had any idea what was in store should he become a doctor Of course as a pre med college grad he had a fair idea of the physicality of what lay ahead but what of the demands it would make on his heart his soul He could manage flesh and bone but what of failure grief overwhelming stress He couldnt imagine what was ahead this young man rushing to a medical school interview In the gospel passage we hear today Jesus approached four fishermen Simon An drew James and John and as St Mark wrote Jesus said to them Follow me And immediately they followed him Mark 11718 Could they ever have imagined where their following would lead them Would they have dropped their fishing nets and run off had they known that they were to share in the suffering and death of Jesus They couldnt have imagined They couldnt have known But they went The young man on the hospitals bridged walkwayhe yearned to be a doctor his heart having heard something of the call that prompted the fishermen to drop their nets Buttoning his top shirt button and adjusting his tie he calmed as he moved on toward what lay ahead He couldnt have imagined He couldnt have known But he went WELCOME Jan 2021 Fr Vincent Joseph Jan
