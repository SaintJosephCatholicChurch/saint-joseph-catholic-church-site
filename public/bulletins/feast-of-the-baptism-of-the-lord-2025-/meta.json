January 11th12th the Church celebrates the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord This feast serves as the official end of our Christmas season and leads us this coming Monday into Ordinary Time Traditionally this feast day marked the Octave Day of the Epiphany as it focused on the second of three mysteries of the Epiphany 1 The Magi 2 The Baptism of the Lord 3 The Wedding Feast of Cana Jesus being now thirty years old comes to the Jordan a river already known for the prophetic miracles wrought in its waters The Jewish people called by the preaching of St John the Baptist came seeking a baptism which could indeed excite a sorrow for sin but could not effect its forgiveness The Lord in turn approaches the river not to receive sanctification but to sanctify the waters themself to serve as a source of supernatural life Through His baptism in the Jordan Jesus makes the Sacrament of Baptism the gateway to discipleship Through our own baptism we are drawn into the life of Christ and the family of God Passing through the saving waters of the Sacrament of Baptism we are claimed as beloved children of God marked by the Holy Spirit and united with Christ Truly it is in this moment that our life in Christ begins The Sacrament of Baptism not only serves as a beginning so it also serves as a calling United to the Body of Christ we begin our mission in Christ as we share in His threefold role as priest prophet and king Through our Baptism we are called to offer our lives as sacrifice priest spread Gods message to all nations prophet and to serve others and establish Gods kingdom of peace love and truth king Teaching Mass Thursday Jan 16th at 6:30PM Join us on Thursday Jan 16th at 6:30PM in the Church for a Teaching Mass Though not an actual Mass this event is a walk through of the liturgy itself that highlights and explores the rich meaning behind the various elements both prayers and items of the Mass This special event offers us an opportunity to deepen our understanding and appreciation of the Mass All are welcome come with questions and an open heart If you know of anyone outside of our parish who may be interested in learning about the Catholic Mass please invite them to join us as well In the words of Scott Hahn The liturgy is where heaven and earth meet and we encounter the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world There is no more beautiful experience to introduce someone to the Faith then Mass itself Ministry to Retirement Communities and Hospitals As a reminder our parish has a ministerial outreach to those at our local retirement communities andor at Bluffton Regional Hospital This ministry includes personal visits Anointing of the Sick and Communion calls at all facilities several times a month or as frequently as needed We also celebrate Mass throughout the month at two of our retirement communities River Terrace and Christian Care If you have a loved one living at or moving into any of our local retirement communities who like to be visited River Terrace Christian Care Ossian Health or Markle Health please do not hesitate to reach out to the Parish Office This helps to ensure that our parish family remains united and that our loved ones who may no longer be able to join us at Mass continue to have frequent access to the Sacraments Similarly if a family member is going to be in the hospital for surgery or recovery please do not hesitate to contact the Parish Office to arrange for Anointing of the Sick prior to any major surgery Or if a family member will be in the hospital for an extended period to arrange for weekly Communion calls so that they might continue to receive our Lord in the Holy Eucharist Due to HIPPA laws our Parish Office is unable to receive any information from hospitals or care facilities directly Instead we must be directly informed of any such needs by family members Becky Biberstein Michael Green Frances Carr Tom Richhart Troy Cook Bobbie Jackson
