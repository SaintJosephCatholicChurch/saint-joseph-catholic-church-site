  "text": "Thirtieth Sunday in Ordinary Time October 23 2022 This weekend October 22nd 23rd the Church celebrates the Thirtieth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings today focus on humility Humility is the recognition that no matter what our accomplishments we always need God in our lives Through this recognition we begin walking along in the spiritual life as we realize that we in this life are on a journey towards God Or in the words of St Therese of Lisieux The world is our ship and not our home Reminder Next weekend will be the first of three weekends to have your picture taken for our upcoming Parish Directory after all weekend Masses All Saints Day and All Souls Day On Tuesday November 1st we celebrate the Solemnity of All Saints which is a Holy Day of Obligation Mass times for our holy day obligation are Vigil Mass on Monday Oct 31st at 7 PM Masses on Tuesday November 1st at 7:00AM Noon and 6:00PM Following the 6:00PM Mass you are invited to our annual All Saints Day Party and Potluck in the Parish Social Hall As is our parish custom you are also invited and encouraged to come dressed as your favorite Saint On Wednesday November 2nd we commemorate All Souls Day Though not a holy day this is a day meant to be set apart in a special way for prayer offered in memory of our deceased loved ones On this day Masses will be offered at 8:00AM Noon and 6:00PM Cemetery Please note the 6:00PM Mass will be offered outside at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery Address 3500 IN 124 Bluffton IN 46714 If you will be joining us for the Mass at the cemetery please bring your own chair Throughout the month of November which is a month dedicated to the holy souls in Purgatory we are encouraged to pray for the faithful departed This spiritual work of mercy helps to assist those in purgation along in their journey toward heaven 2 Maccabees 1239 46 Prayer is a bond that helps to unite all members of the Body of Christ in heaven on earth and undergoing purgation As a part of this work of mercy I encourage you to visit our many local cemeteries throughout November and offer prayers for those who now rest there I will in turn be visiting and blessing gravestones at cemeteries within the county throughout November If you would like me to visit and bless the gravestone of a loved one please see the sign up sheet in the Narthex The Bells of St Joseph and the Rainy Day Repair Fund As you may have noticed over the past few weeks we have been facing some issues with our parish bell system The steeple on the Church houses a speaker controlled by a carillon system in the sacristy Installed in 1989 it appears that our system is beginning to fail and can no longer dependably play full songs Often the songs have been ending abruptly and prematurely Working with the repair technician from Chime Master which installed our system it seems that the carillon system is coming to the end of its life span after 34 faithful years The drivers that control the compact disc system are beginning to fail As Chime Master no longer produces these drivers they cannot be easily or reliably replaced While we will have Chime Master perform a thorough review of our carillon to see if any long term repair is possible it does seem that we will need to consider moving towards a new system We've already received suggested upgrades from Chime Master which have been forwarded to our Parish Council and our Finance Council for review Whether a needed repair or upgrade this is an unexpected and unbudgeted for expense Thanks to your continuous generosity to the Rainy Day Repair Fund however we are in a financial position to immediately address this issue Thank you for your continued generosity to this monthly fund which allows us to maintain our parish campus and to our monthly St Vincent de Paul Fund which allows us to help those in need within our community Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday October 22 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm
