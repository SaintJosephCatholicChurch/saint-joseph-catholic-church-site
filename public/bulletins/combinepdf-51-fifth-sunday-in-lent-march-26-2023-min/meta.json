  "text": "Fifth Sunday of Lent March 26 2023 This weekend March 25th 26th the Church celebrates the Fifth Sunday of Lent This weekend was formerly known as Passion Sunday marked with the reading of the Passion narrative and the next two weeks as Passiontide as we turn our focus totally on the passion and death of Christ For this reason both our crucifixes and statues remain veiled from this weekend on until Easter Sunday The past four weeks seems to have been but a preparation for the intense grief of the Church during these next two At this point in the Gospel men are in search of Jesus and are bent on His death Before our twelve days are over they will lay hands upon Him We will be called to follow Him up the hill of Calvary to see His last breath and witness the stone placed against the sepulchre Yet we are not simply asked to show compassion and shed tears for our Redeemer but to learn from the lesions that are being taught to us in His Passion and Death After our Masses last weekend I heard from multiple visitors to our parish commenting on the amazing number of young children that were present at Mass Many parishes do not currently share this same blessing that we are seeing at our parish right here and now Over the past four months weve had the great joy of celebrating five baptisms for our parish and have at least four more scheduled in the weeks to come This is of course something to rejoice about The presence of our littlest parishioners at Mass is a beautiful and incarnate reminder that our parish is growing and the Faith continues to be spread from generation to generation As the old adage says parish that isn't crying is dying To all of our parents and grandparents bringing little ones to Mass each weekend Thank You Know of our profound gratitude and support for you and the seriousness with which you are undertaking the passing on of the Faith to our future generations As our parish continues to grow we need to be always thinking of the future that lies ahead This includes my own discernment as pastor of our parish Over this past year given the several additional ministries for our diocese that I've been assigned I've had to recognize certain limitations in my own ministry here At the prompting of our Parish Council and following discussions with our Finance Council we are now in the planning stages to grow our parish staff with the addition of a new part time position This new position will both serve to promote parish development and act as a direct resource to the pastor Essentially it will serve as an engagement director for our parish to promote and assist with various events both big and small throughout the year Currently a significant amount of both event planning and logistics falls first to either Michelle in the Parish Office or myself With our desire to focus on continuing growth and outreach this current approach is not sustainable in the long term This new position will help centralize the planning of our several major parish gatherings Parish Picnic All Saints Day Christmas Brunch the Easter Egg Hunt and Totus Tuus organize volunteer activities and allow for the planning and starting up of smaller events and gatherings Bible Studies Youth Group events etc This will also help to ensure that our events will not be reliant on the pastor and will be sustainable in the years to come In your kindness please offer a prayer for the development of this position as the Parish Council and myself work with our diocesan Human Resources department to prepare a full description of this position Parish Penance Service Wednesday March 29th As a general reminder we will have our Lenten Parish Penance Service this Wednesday March 29th from 6:00PM to 7:00PM We will be joined by Fr Stephen Colchin Fr Dave Ruppert and Fr Jonathan Agbedo as additional confessors for the evening If you haven't yet had the opportunity to make use of this Sacrament this Lenten season I
