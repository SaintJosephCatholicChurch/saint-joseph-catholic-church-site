  "text": "WENTY INTH UNDAY I RDINARY IME CTOBER 17 2021 This weekend October 16th 17th the Church celebrates the Twenty ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings continue to highlight the true cost of discipleship If we dare to follow Jesus Christ we begin a journey and a relationship that is meant to carryover into eternal life This journey is no easy path This relationship will call us to conversion But it will also bring about a life that is filled with a joy that knows no end and can overcome every storm In our Gospel Mark 103545 Sts James and John do not yet understand what they are asking for They do not yet at this time in St Marks Gospel understand the Cross In the end however St James will be the first Apostle but not the last to shed his blood for the name of Jesus Christ St John likewise will suffer greatly for the sake of the Gospel being plunged into burning oil before being sent into exile In their willingness to give even their lives to preach the Gospel Sts James and John witness to true discipleship They are no longer asking for positions of authority Mark 1037 but instead uniting themselves to the suffering Servant from our first reading Isaiah 531011 who is Jesus Christ In uniting themselves to our Savior they made Him present to those to whom they preached and served We in turn must do the same allowing the Lord to work and live through us by uniting ourselves to Him NNUAL ISHOP PPEAL Thank you to everyone who has already made your pledge for the Annual Bishops Appeal We are so thankful for your generosity For those who have not yet had the opportunity to make a pledge thank you for prayerfully considering the way that the Lord is calling you to sacrificial generosity in support of the local Church The Annual Bishops Appeal is critical for the financial health not only of our Diocese but also of our parish You can take a pledge card from the entrance of the church to fill out We will be sending a follow up letter to all those who have not yet turned in a pledge card later this week As a reminder any overage returned to the parish will support an updated playground on the southside of our campus to be installed in the Spring of 2022 ONTINUING DUCATION AYS ATHOLIC OCIAL OCTRINE After my weekend away I spent most of this past week at Pokagon State Park in Angola Our entire diocesan presbyterate which includes all priests and deacons serving in active ministry throughout our diocese gathered for three days of conferences for our Continuing Education days This yearly gathering serves as a reminder that each of us are always called to grow in knowledge of God and His interactions within the world We cannot simply stop our studies but are always called to be students of the Master This year our week covered a number of issues related to Catholic Social Doctrine We heard from several speakers from Notre Dame University who presented on topics regarding the care of the environment dignity of work racism preferential options for the poor and immigration and refugees Each presentation was followed by a round of questions and often much discussion on how to best preach on such topics within parish life Overall the great commonality found within these teachings involves an encounter By encountering the other our neighbor we encounter the face of Christ in them This encounter with Christ is meant to change everything Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday October 16 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Evelyn Morrissey Sunday October 17 TwentyNinth Sunday in
