Ends National Vocation Awareness Week Thirtieth Sunday in Ordinary Time October 29 2023 This weekend Oct 28th 29th the Church celebrates the Thirtieth Sunday in Ordinary Time Taking a cue from the world around us we see how the weather is changing and know that harvest time is upon us Similarly in our liturgical life we know that the end of the liturgical year is near With this focus on the end of things the Church has traditionally held the upcoming month of November as a time devoted to the Holy Souls in Purgatory This devotion to pray for those who have gone before us reminds us of a simple truth Memento Mori or Remember your death Our prayer for the Holy Souls calls to mind our own mortality and the reality that as is often said in the Mass of Christian Burial for your faithful Lord life is changed not ended When this earthly dwelling turns to dust an eternal dwelling is made ready for them in heaven Preface I for the Dead Solemnity of All Saints Holy Day of Obligation On Wednesday November 1st the Church celebrates the Solemnity of All Saints a Holy Day of Obligation This solemnity is rooted in the Feast of All Martyrs celebrated among our eastern Churches in the beginning of the 4th Century It became recognized in the west with the dedication of the Roman Pantheon as the Basilica of St Mary and the Martyrs on May 13 609 In the middle of the 9th Century this celebration was transferred to November 1st and its observance placed on the universal calendar as we know it today To aide in our obligation to assist at Mass for this holy day we are offering four different Mass times All Saints Day Vigil Mass Tuesday Oct 31st 7pm All Saints Day Mass Wednesday Nov 1st 7am 12pm 6pm Following the 6:00pm Mass you are invited to join us for our annual All Saints Day Party in the Parish Social Hall The parish is providing both the main entree and drinks and invites you to bring a side dish to share You are invited to dress as your favorite Saint for our costume contest and there will be a number of children games hosted in the Parish Gym On Thursday November 2nd the Church marks the Commemoration of All Souls Though this day is not a holy day it is an important day where we remember and pray for all those who have died We will offer Masses for All Souls Day on Thursday Nov 2nd at 8am 12pm and 6pm Note The 6pm All Souls Day Mass will be at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery Please bring your own chair for this Mass New Flagpoles Thank you to all those who joined us for the re dedication and blessing of the church bell this past Sunday As you may have noticed in addition to returning the church bell to our parish campus we've also installed two new flagpoles alongside it thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor These flagpoles stand 30 feet in the air and are fairly level with the highest peak of our building's roofline Though the flagpoles are tall the highest peak on our campus still remains to be the cross atop of the Church itself which is as we say in the preface dialogue during Mass truly right and just As of this weekend we are flying both the American Flag and the Vatican Flag on our campus during daylight hours In the coming weeks we hope to have several spotlights installed at the base of the flagpoles so that we will be able to fly the flags both day and night As the Vatican Flag is the official flag of the Vatican City State which is a sovereign nation these two flags of approximately equal size shall be flown from separate staffs of the same height as directed in 4 US Code 7 subsection g Next weekend we will welcome Fr Bill Sullivan as the celebrant at all our weekend Masses Thank you as always for welcoming Fr Bill I will be away for the weekend to celebrate the wedding of a close friend in
