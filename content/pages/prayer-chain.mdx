<p>The Prayer Chain Ministry is a ministry where a &ldquo;chain&rdquo; of people constantly pray for those individuals who are in need of prayers. Prayer request can come from anyone and the prayer intention may be for any reason for which one believes prayer will be beneficial, bearing in mind the place of our faith in answers to our prayers (<a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/matthew/9?22">Matt 9:22</a>, <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/matthew/9?28">28</a>; <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/luke/1?5">Lk 5:20</a>; <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/james/1?5">James 1:5-8</a>).</p>
<p>Personal Privacy is protected, so the prayer intentions and the name of the person for whom the prayer is being offered, are mentioned only to the extent the person making the prayer request wishes to communicate to &lsquo;the prayer warriors&rsquo;. These &lsquo;Prayer Warriors&rsquo; receive an email, sent BCC to all of them, so one need not worry about one&rsquo;s email address going out without one&rsquo;s knowledge or permission.</p>
<p>If then you have a prayer request or are interested in joining the prayer chain, please contact Michelle Paxton at the Parish Office&nbsp;<a href="mailto:stjosephchurch@adamswells.com">stjosephchurch@adamswells.com</a> or by phone at <a href="tel: (260) 824-1380">(260) 824-1380</a> and she will contact Tammy Mechling who will then send out the email.</p>
<p>Note also that you can still be involved even if you do not have an email address and want to be communicated or notified by phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, [amen,] I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything for which they are to pray, it shall be granted to them by my heavenly Father. For where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them&rdquo; (<a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/matthew/18?19">Matt 18:19-20</a>)</p>
