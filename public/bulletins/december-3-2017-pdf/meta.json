brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all In this weekend we begin a new Liturgical year Sunday readings are taken from Circle and weekday readings are taken from Cycle11 Thus today also is the first Sunday of Advent and thus we are beginning the season of Advent We have 4 weeks to go So be prepared to work hard and then be ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ Prepare for this coming Christmas as if it is your first Advent and Christmas and will be your last Ad vent and Christmas here on earth Stay awake be vigilant be on your guard and be prepared for you do not know when the Lord is coming This reminds us of the cry of the early Christian MARANATHA Come Lord Jesus Think of this Imagine this is happening as you come home In your house you saw your 4 or5 months child crawling towards the railings of the upstairs and the railings have spaces such that the baby could crawl through any of them and fall from up there to the ground where you were standing and the babysitter was on a chair sleeping deeply in the living room And the baby was almost falling How would you feel Think about it Imagine that it happened What will you do What would you think of the babysitter So be awake Do not allow yourself to be caught sleeping on duty by the Lord Jesus when He comes We need to be vigilant awake sober prepared and waiting for His coming MARANATHA Come Lord Jesus In the First Reading Is 6316b17 19b 6427 Was pleading on our behalf so liciting God to come down from heaven Asking Him not to be angry with us in spite of our sins So do not let the apologies of Prophet Isaiah on our behalf be in vain for you as a person Recognize that we are the clay and God is the potter If we are the clay we are then weak but we need to struggle make effort to be good clay in the hands of God Again in the Second Reading 1 Cor 139St Paul was praying for us Do you know that Isaiah all the prophets St Paul and all the Saints are praying for us Angels and Archangels are praying and interceding for us The Church is praying for us I am praying for you every day I am sure you are praying for me too Christ Himself is pleading for us before the Father Since all these are praying for us why cant we try and help ourselves and be saved If anyone is not seen in heaven that person must blame himself or herself If you look around you will see that some people have begun to clean and decorate their homes their shops their surroundings and streets These are signs and good prepa rations for Christmas As you prepare your homes your places of work your surround ings and streets do not forget to prepare your soul which is the most important thing to be prepared at Christmas for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ He the Lord Jesus Christ admonished us in the Gospel Mk 133337 He said Be watchful Be alert You do not know when the time will come Thus prepare yourself and help others to prepare themselves by going to confession and confess your sins Make peace with your neighbors Forgive those who offended you Let go the past and get prepare for the future Help your wife your husband your children your parents and your neighbors to prepare well for the Lords coming Remember our parish Confession on December 11th by 7:00pm here in this Church Create awareness by helping others to know and go to Confession Dust off the dust of sin in your soul so that Christ will be born in you in your family and in your neighborhood Remember The Story of the Two Bottles Stay awake Be ready and wait MARANATHA Come Lord Jesus God bless you Rev Msgr Pius
