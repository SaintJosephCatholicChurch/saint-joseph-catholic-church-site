  "text": "WENTY IFTH UNDAY I RDINARY IME EPTEMBER 19 2021 This weekend September 18th 19th the Church celebrates the Twenty fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time Over the next several weekends we will continue to hear of our Lord speaking on the demands of discipleship throughout the Gospel of St Mark This theme will culminate in the end of the liturgical year as we celebrate the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe Forty Days for Life This coming Wednesday September 22nd marks the beginning of the national Forty Days for Life campaign During these forty days September 22nd October 31st we are called in a special way to pray fast and witness for an end to the evils of abortion and for the protection of all human life throughout our society As the right to life is that most basic of human rights we are called to defend it with maximum determination if we hope to further any other human rights cf Pope St John Paul IIs two encyclicals Christifideles Laici Para 38 Evangelium vitae Para 101 This understanding of the evil of abortion was clearly reiterated earlier this week by Pope Francis Speaking to reporters following the papal visit to Slovakia Pope Francis strongly stated Abortion is more than an issue Abortion is murder Its a human life period This human life must be respected This principle is so clear With this understanding we can see why the Church is so strict on this issue Because accepting this is kind of like accepting daily murder Watch for updates in the coming weeks on opportunities that will arise throughout the Fort Days for Life May we serve as consistent witnesses to life from conception to natural death and the dignity of each human person APTISMAL ONT This coming Thursday September 23rd Mazzolini Artcraft is scheduled to deliver our repaired baptismal font to the parish Thanks to their work and the generous support fundraised by our GIRLs Night Out our baptismal font will continue to serve our parish family for years to come Passing through the waters of baptism from this font the newly baptized will join our eucharistic community as members of the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ Over the years our baptismal font has often found itself placed in many different spots throughout the church building Originally placed in the Baptistry now the Ushers Room it has also been placed in various spots in both the sanctuary and nave As it returns we will be relocating the font from the sanctuary to the center of the narthex or gathering space This location has both practical and theological implications that this column will look at next weekend SHER OOM AND ENERAL EATING At the suggestion of our Parish Council and due to the increased need we will be opening up our Ushers Room opposite of the Cry Room for seating during our weekend Mass times This limited seating will be primarily reserved for parishioners who due to health reasons cannot be seated in a pew for an extended period The room itself has been reorganized and now has several padded chairs and two rocking chairs for seating Please note Though the Ushers Room will be open for seating the Choir Loft remains reserved for the choir Faithfully in Christ Fr
