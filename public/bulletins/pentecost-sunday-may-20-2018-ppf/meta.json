MEN AND WOMEN OF ACTION NOT JUST WORDS My dear brothers and sisters in Christ the Lord be with you Today we celebrate the Solemnity of the Pentecost Today is the 2018th Anniversary of the Church for She was born on the Pentecost Day in the upper room in Jerusalem Thus The Holy Spirit is a gift from the Father the Spirit of Truth He is the ruah Yahweh the breath of God he animating Spirit of God The Holy Spirit is the Spirit that gives life the Spirit of love the Spirit of power the Spirit that empowers and moves us to action We all have been baptized into one and the same Spirit Let us live then by the Spirit That same Spirit the advocate who renews the face of the earth was given to the disciples and to us to strengthen us to go forth in the name of the Lord Jesus to preach to the whole world and obtain forgiveness of sins If you listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and act accordingly you will never fall away from Gods love and the shackles of the flesh will never dominate you The Holy Spirit will remind you of all that the Lord Jesus taught He will enlighten you and help you to understand our religion As I have already said today is the 2018th Birthday Anniversary of the Catholic Church for the Church was born on Pentecost Day in Jerusalem In the 1st Reading Acts 2111 They were all in one place together And sud denly there came from sky a noise like a strong driving wind and it filled the en tire house in which they were Then there appeared to them tongues of fire which parted and came to rest on each of them And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues as the Spirit enabled them to pro claim There and there the Church was born the establishment of the New Israel the Church you and me all of us With the help of the Spirit we will be able to em brace the 7 Gifts and the 12 Fruit of the Holy Spirit and practice them for our sanctifi cation and salvation Let us make effort to listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit Do your best also to avoid the sin against the Holy Spirit The Lord Jesus said if any one sins against the Father or against the Son heshe will be forgiven but anyone who sins against the Holy Spirit will neither be forgiven neither here on earth nor in the world to come It is an unforgivable sin Wow Which of the sins is that unforgivable sin So let us be very careful not to commit such sin against the Holy Spirit Such you know the sin For I have told you already some time ago So now you have known which sin is the sin against the Holy Spirit However let me tell you again Which sin is the sin against the Holy Spirit In Theol ogy there is what we call a state of Obduracy It is a state when a sinner can no longer recognize sin as sin nor see goodness as good When heshe sees sin it appears good So heshe goes on sinning and sinning and sinning for it appears good Then heshe avoids good for it appears sinful For such a person there is no possibility of repentance This kind of state is a state of Obduracy and so it is sin against the Holy Spirit So no one particular sin is the sin against the Holy Spirit but a state of sinful ness a state of Obduracy Thus With the celebration of the Pentecost we come to the end of Easter period Ordi nary Time resumes on Monday May 21 The Regina Caeli prayer we pray during Easter period at 6:00am 1200 Midday noon 6:00pm and at

living love in the sun aboveAll here and near and ours Charlotte Perkins Gilman Today our Bishop His Lordship Most Rev Kevin Rhoades is asking us to generously give for the support of training of Semi

you It is a Priest Who hears your Confessions blesses you cele brates the Holy Mass for you It is always a Priest So help train priests for we need their services for our salvation I myself Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu who is standing here before you now I was trained by the financial help of an Austrian Blind Woman Anna Schunher As a blind woman she used to knit socks table cloths and other things and sold them and gave money to my Bishop She died on August 24 2006 May she rest in the peace of Christ Amen She was not a rich woman but she helped a lot And here I am among you The Church in USA is now benefiting from the generosity of an Austrian blind woman You can see that the Catholic Church is One Family of Jesus Christ Wherever we are or wherever we work in the Church it is in the same One Family of Jesus Christ So let us work together to build up the Church the body of Christ God bless you Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it ATTENTION
