<p>Becoming a Knight can transform your life. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re interested in helping others, serving your parish, or growing in your faith, or having access to top-rated insurance protection, then the Knights of Columbus is the organization for you.</p>
<p>Charity is first principal of the Knights of Columbus. &nbsp;In the past decade the Knights of Columbus have donated more than $1.4 billion and 664 million volunteer hours to worthy causes. &nbsp;Unity and Fraternity are the second and third principals. &nbsp;The Knights of Columbus was founded so that men could work together to save their parishes and communities, protect the well-being of their Catholic families, and support each other in faith and in many other ways along life&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably asking yourself &ndash; &ldquo;So if I join, what am I getting myself into?&rdquo; &nbsp;Here at St. Joseph&rsquo;s in Bluffton, our Council meets the first Tuesday of each month at 7:00 pm in the parish hall. &nbsp;Many of us arrive early to pray the Rosary at 6:45 in the Church. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s been a long time, or if you were never taught how to pray the Rosary we&rsquo;ll be glad to teach you. &nbsp;When we started the Council I don&rsquo;t think there were half a dozen Knights who cold have prayed the Rosary from memory. &nbsp;Our business meeting basically consists of the reports of the Officers and the Committee Directors dealing with whatever projects are coming up. &nbsp;We end each meeting with a short presentation on a topic designed to help us grow in our faith. &nbsp;We do keep the meeting moving, we try to be done in about an hour, and then we end with prayer. &nbsp;You can make of the Knights of Columbus what you want. &nbsp;There are dozens of activities you may choose to get involved with if you wish. &nbsp;For the present our Council has chosen to focus on Faith and Pro-Life. &nbsp;If you want to get the big picture of what the Knights of Columbus is about you may want to check out the web site at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kofc.org/">www.kofc.org</a>&nbsp;where you&rsquo;ll no doubt find more information abut the Knights of Columbus than you&rsquo;ll know what to do with.</p>
<p>During the Last Supper Jesus took a towel and tied it around his waist. &nbsp;Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet. &nbsp;When the Lord had finished he said: &ldquo;I have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do.&rdquo; &nbsp;The Catechism of the Catholic Church says that God created us so that we could know, love, and serve Him. &nbsp;We serve God by serving others. &nbsp;This is know as charity, or love: and God is love. &nbsp;So we strive to serve our Lord. &nbsp;Basically that&rsquo;s what the Knights of Columbus are all about &ndash; Faith and Good Works. &nbsp;As Knights we are called to imitate Christ. &nbsp;Prayer is our sword, Good Works our shield. &nbsp;We would be very pleased if you should decide to join us in our service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Yours in Christ,</p>
<p>The Members of Council # 7555</p>
