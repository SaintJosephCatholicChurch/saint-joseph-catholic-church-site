  "text": "APTISM OF THE ORD JANUARY 9 2022 This weekend January 8th 9th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Baptism of the Lord This celebration brings an end to our Christmas season though there will be a brief resurgence of Christmas on the Feast of the Pres entation or Candlemas on February 2nd As such though our Nativity scene will be taken down many of our beautiful Christmas lights and decorations will remain in the Church for the remainder of the month May they serve as a re minder that the joy of the Incarnation is to always remain evident in our lives ID OU NOW ATHOLICS ARE HRISTIANS This week begins our Did You Know Campaign Our inaugural topic is simple and straightforward Catholics are Christians The term Christian is itself derived from the name of Christ As recorded in the Acts of the Apostles it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians Acts 1126 Christian is generally defined in most basic terms as one who has been baptized recognizes Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior and lives their life according to His teachings This definition itself comes from our Lords Great Commission Matthew 281620 For a fuller fleshingout of our Christian beliefs we often turn to creeds The Nicene Creed has served as the basic promulgation of the Christian Faith for nearly 1700 years In the 4th Century St Cyril of Jerusalem describes the Creed as that which was not made to accord with human opinions but rather what was of the greatest importance was gathered from all the Scriptures to present the one teaching of the faith in its entirety Catechetical Lecture 512 In the basic definition of a Christian and in keeping to the Creeds full theological description of the Faith we find the Catholic Church As Catholics we are baptized followers of Jesus Christ We continue to proclaim and live out the one Faith which has been handed down from the very beginning when Jesus Christ Himself founded the Catholic Church Matthew 161320 From this understanding we can see that Catholics are Christian The term Catholic itself simply means universal Its first recorded use comes from St Ignatius Bishop of Antioch as he wrote to the Church in Smyrna As he being led to martyrdom in 107 AD he reminded the Christians in Smyrna that the Church is to be united as one universal Where the bishop is present there is the Catholic Church Smyrnaeans 82 This use was found again in the words of St Polycarp Bishop of Smyrna and a direct disciple of St John the Apostle as he prayed for the whole Catholic Church throughout the world at his martyrdom in 155 AD The term was already understood even by the 2nd Century to be an especially fitting name because the Catholic Church was for everyone everywhere who followed Jesus Christ YNOD ON YNODALITY PDATES We have received our first update regarding the 2023 Bishops Synod For a Synodal Church Communion Participation and Mission This synod which seeks input from dioceses and parishes worldwide is looking at how the Holy Spirit continues to guide the Church today To help with this process our diocese has provided us with a variety of questions that we have been asked to prayerfully ponder over the coming weeks On Saturday February 12th an open forum beginning at 8:00AM with Mass and a Holy Hour will be held at Sts Peter Paul in Huntington for all of the parishioners within our vicariate This open forum will serve as an opportu nity for all parishioners to provide input and insight in the lead up to the Synod For those who cannot attend the open forum date please forward me
