  "text": "Divine Mercy SundaySecond Sunday of Easter April 24 2022 This weekend the Church celebrates the Second Sunday of Easter which is the last day in the Octave of Easter It is a day that has many different names Historically this weekend was called Low Sunday referring to the newly baptized who on this day would remove the baptismal garments they received at the Easter Vigil and take their place among the Faithful Their joining in the general assembly of the Church invites each of us to spend the fifty days of Easter reflecting on the Lord's presence in the sacramental life of the Church At the beginning of the new millennium Pope St John Paul II named this weekend as The Second Sunday of Easter or Divine Mercy Sunday in reference to the devotion to Divine Mercy from the Diary of St Maria Faustina Kowalska This day is meant to emphasize our risen Lord's incredible and undeserved mercy given to the Apostles seen in their ability to forgive sins cf John 2019 21 As revealed to St Faustina our Lord wants people to trust in his mercy to ask for it and to allow themselves to be vessels of his mercy for others One of the ways that we ask for the Lord's mercy is in the Sacrament of Reconciliation or Confession In Confession we come into contact with and receive the Lords Divine Mercy As a reminder this Sacrament is offered to us at all times throughout the year If you are in the habit of only going to Confession during the penitential seasons of Advent and Lent this is the perfect time to make a commitment to make more frequent use of this Sacrament This allows our Lord's mercy to serve as a wellspring of grace that helps us to become the person that He has made us to be Marking the end of the Easter Octave I would like to offer a special Thank You to the many hands that made our Lent Holy Week Triduum and Easter celebrations so powerful Throughout our liturgies we were blessed to have our hearts and minds lifted in prayer by both our Adult Choir and Children's Choir under the direction of Teresa our Choir Director Our wonderful music was also beautifully matched to the wonderful decorations arranged by our Sacred Space Committee Our Master of Ceremonies Dan and our altar servers helped to lead us in prayer throughout our many liturgies Thanks to their diligent efforts our liturgies moved seamlessly throughout the week Our RCIA Coordinator Jill spent the year helping to prepare our Candidate for Full Communion And the many hands behind the scenes including Michelle in the Parish Office and Nathan Corey and Rick provided me with invaluable support during this time and at all other times of the year as well Though the Easter Octave is coming to an end the Easter season itself continues This season is the longest in the Church year lasting for fifty days And rightfully so The entire Church year has led to this season The holy longings of Advent the sweet joys of Christmas the contrition and penance of Lent the heart rending sight of the Passion all were given us as preliminaries as paths to the sublime and glorious Pasch which is now ours May our rejoicing carry us into the true and never end Pasch Heaven Ask Father Session Join us for our second ever Ask Father Session this coming Thursday April 28th at 6:30PM in the Church This session is an opportunity for you to ask any questions concerning our Faith the Church and the world we live in and any other topic you can think of and I will do my best to provide a thorough response This format also allows for plenty of room for discussion and sharing of experiences depending of
