2018 Year special Thank You for the birthday wishes It was a joy to celebrate this day with my parish family This Thursday Dec 20th at 7 PM we conclude our Advent Parish Mission as we meditate upon the Gift of Myrrh the third and final gift brought to the Christ Child by the Magi Before to the Parish Mission all are invited to join us at 6 PM in the Social Hall for our Soup Supper special Thank You to the Parish Council the Womens Group and the Knights of Columbus for taking turns to host the soup suppers Immediately following the Parish Mission will be our Parish Penance Service from 730 8:30PM on Thursday Dec 20th If youve not yet had a chance to make a confession this Advent I encourage you to do so We will have sev eral visiting priests with us for confessions An Examination of Conscience has been included in this bulletin to help us prepare for our Penance Service and to make a good confession As St Alphonsus Liguori once said You will feel more happy at having confessed your sins than if you had been made monarch of the whole world Reflection on the Third Sunday of Advent Today the Church celebrate Gaudete Sunday The word Gaudete is Latin for Rejoice and is the first word of the Entrance Antiphon of our Mass today which states Rejoice in the Lord always Again I say rejoice Indeed the Lord is near Phil 445 This Sunday serves as our reminder that though we walk now in a penitential season this season will soon give way to one of great re joicing Advent is always meant to prepare us for and lead us to the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ For the same reason the priest wears rose today which mixes the violet of Advent a penitential color with the gold of Christmas a color of joy This call to rejoice is even reflected in our readings today In our first reading Zep 31418 the prophet Zephaniah calls Israel to be ready to rejoice when God restores Jerusalem Israel has fallen away from the Lord through idol worship and Zephaniah prophesies the judgment that Israel will face for their transgressions This prophecy finds its fulfillment in the Babylonian Exile and the destruction of Jerusalem that comes shortly after Zephaniahs ministry in the 6th Century BC But as Zephaniah concludes his prophecy the Lord will restore Jerusalem and return Israel to the Promised Land For this they are to rejoice or as the Psalmist says to cry out with joy and gladness This joy is again seen in our second reading Phil 447 as St Paul exhorts the Philippians to trust in the Lord always As St Paul is himself writing from prison awaiting trial for preaching the Gospel his calls to trust in the Lord are not sim ply words but a lived example How to live out this trust in our lives is found our Gospel today Luke 31018St John the Baptist attracting crowds by his au thentic witness and his message of repentance calls us to live lives in service to each other The crowds excited by St John hear his call and recognize that the time of the Messiah is near St Johns message is not extraordinary by any means but is a reminder that this life is not our end Instead we live not for this life but for life in the world to come This means living for one another and not for ourselves How will we spend the remainder of our Advent season giving the gift of our time talent and treasure to those around us Fr David Come Lord Jesus Grant we pray almighty God that we who are weighed down from of old by slavery beneath the yoke of sin may be set free by the newness of the longawaited Na tivity of your Only Begotten Son Amen WEEKEND OF December 2223 2018 CANTORS 500
