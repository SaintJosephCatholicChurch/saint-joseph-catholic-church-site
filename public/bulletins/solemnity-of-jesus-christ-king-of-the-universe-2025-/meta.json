Christ King of the Universe November 23 2025 Join us on Thanksgiving Day Thursday Nov 27th for Mass at 9 AM as we begin Thanksgiving Day by first giving thanks to Almighty God There is no better way to begin this day of thankfulness than with the Eucharist which coming from the Greek eucharisteo means to give thanks This weekend November 22nd 23th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe This solemnity was originally created as a feast day one hundred years ago in 1925 by Pope Pius XI Following the horrific loss of life experienced during the Great War Pius XI saw that the world was drifting away from Jesus Christ and had hoped that this feast day would help to reawaken society's recognition of Christ as King In his papal encyclical Quas primas Pius described this feast day as the response to the rapid rise of secularism experienced throughout various European nations The fall of local governments and collapse of monarchies gave way to the totalitarian regimes of both communism and fascism Quas primas offered the stern reminder that no state ideology or individual could ever take the place of Christ as King Perhaps prophetically Pius XI cautioned that as individuals and states refuse to submit to the rule of our Savior there will be no really hopeful prospect of a lasting peace among nations Instead when Christ is rejected societies collapse and war too often follows It is only when we recognize both in private in public life that Christ is King society will at last receive the great blessings of real liberty well ordered discipline peace harmony In 1969 Pope St Paul VI elevated this day to a solemnity our highest liturgical celebration and moved it to the last Sunday of the liturgical year These changes sought to emphasize that Christ's kingship is not merely symbolic or historical but oriented toward His triumphant return at the end of time In this way our liturgical year concludes with a renewed proclamation of our hope in Christ's ultimate victory over all creation Forty Hours Devotion and the Consecration to St Joseph Sign ups for our upcoming Forty Hours Devotion are available in the narthex With an opening Mass on Monday Dec 8th at 7 PM for the Holy Day of the Immaculate Conception we will once again enter into a period of continuous adoration of the Blessed Sacrament Adoration will continue throughout this time until our closing Mass on Wednesday Dec 10th at 7 PM At this closing Mass we will make together the Consecration to St Joseph On Tuesday Dec 9th at 7 PM we will welcome Dcn Rob Lortie to serve as a special Eucharistic Speaker for our Forty Hours Dcn Rob will also preach at our opening and closing Masses and is joining us in preparation to renew his own Consecration to St Joseph While still in preparation for the diaconate Dcn Rob and his wife Vickie served as speakers during one of our past Advent missions focused on the Domestic Church I invite and strongly encourage each of us to sign up for time in adoration throughout the Forty Hours If you have never had the opportunity to spend time in adoration now is the time You will be amazed at how the Lord will speak to you in the quiet of your heart if you but make this time for Him Happy Liturgical New Year Next weekend we celebrate the start of a new liturgical year with the First Sunday of Advent This new year will restart our three year lectionary cycle as we return to Year and the Gospel of St Matthew Walking through this Gospel for the coming year we will see how St Matthew writing primarily to a Jewish Christian audience will place a strong emphasis on Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament promises He will also emphasize Jesus teaching on the cost of discipleship especially fitting for those who were cast out of the synagogues and faced familial rejection for their Faith in Jesus Saturday November 22 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Our Parish Family Sunday November 23 7:10am Rosary
