wonderful evening helped to support two good causes Our Parish Youth Group and donating supplies for our local WOW Buses This weekend February 17th18th the Church celebrates the First Sunday in Lent In the words of St Augustine of Hippo As we soon celebrate the Passion of our crucified Lord it is therefore in keeping with our commitment to Him that we should crucify ourselves by restraining the desires of the flesh These forty days of Lent are guided by the spiritual weapons of prayer fasting and almsgiving We will continue our parish practice of almsgiving with our annual Lenten Food Drive Please place your donations in the narthex St Joseph Statue in the Narthex As we are just a month away from our patronal feast day the Solemnity of St Joseph we are blessed to unveil a new statue of St Joseph in our narthex this weekend This statue was originally stored by our Knights of Columbus from a closed hermitage in Decatur We've since helped relocate many of the sacred items from the hermitage for use in various churches Of the items two have remained for use in our own parish The portable altar we use for our altar of repose on Holy Thursday and this St Joseph statue The statue itself was in need of a bit of repair and repainting This work was recently completed for us by the Fort Wayne based William Lupkin Designs Our own parishioner and master craftsman Joe Bauer skillfully crafted the base on which St Joseph now stands We will bless this statue of our patron as a part of our annual St Joseph Table celebrated the weekend near the Solemnity of St Joseph March 19th As St Joseph was charged with the care of the Holy Family so we place our parish family under his prayerful protection St Joseph foster father of the Lord and protector of the universal Church pray for us Entrance Antiphon Communion Antiphon Beginning this weekend our cantors will sing the entrance and communion antiphons at our weekend Masses The entrance antiphon will be sung prior to the opening hymn and the communion antiphon after the priest has received Holy Communion These short beautiful and meditative scriptural verses offer us tremendous insight into the themes of our weekly liturgy Quite often many Sundays received nicknames based upon the antiphons that were sung For example Laetare Sunday is called such as the entrance antiphon begins with the word Laetare or Rejoice May we listen both attentively and prayerfully to our cantors and allow these verses taken from the Sacred Scriptures to help prepare your hearts so that they might be burning within us Luke 2432 as we enter and participate in the sacred mysteries Rite of Election After our last Mass this Sunday I will be traveling with our Catechumens and Candidates for Full Communion to the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Fort Wayne There these eight men and women who have been preparing over this past year will join all those preparing to enter the Church and be welcomed and greeted by Bishop Rhoades Let us continue to pray for these men and women as they prepare to enter the Church at the Easter Vigil Onwards to Pilgrimage On Monday I will be leading a number of pilgrims from our parish to Italy As we begin our pilgrimage we will start with daily Mass Monday morning at 5:30AM before leaving for the airport All are welcome to join us With our layovers and the time difference we should arrive in Rome early Tuesday morning We will keep our whole parish family in prayer as we visit these holy sites and walk along the path that so many have walked before us special thanks to Fr Bill Sullivan for being with us while I am away PARISH CALENDAR Sat Feb 17 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sun Feb 18 Mass 7:30am Mass 10:00am Sun Feb 18 Religious Education Classes 830 9:45am Sun Feb 18
