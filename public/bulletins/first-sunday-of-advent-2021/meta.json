  "text": "IRST UNDAY OF DVENT OVEMBER 28 2021 Happy Liturgical New Year This weekend Nov 27th 28th the Church begins a new year of grace as we enter into the First Sunday of Advent Throughout this cycle of the liturgical year we will walk with our Lord Jesus Christ through the Gospel of St Luke St Luke is believed to be both a physician and a companion of St Paul and as seen in Luke 114 and Acts 113 is the author of both this gospel and the Acts of the Apostles Though beginning a new liturgical and entering a new season we may notice that our readings seem to continue the same apocalyptic trend that we have heard throughout the past several weekends This serves as a reminder that the Advent Season is meant to prepare us for the two comings of Jesus Christ His Second Coming at the end of time and the historical Incarnation The first three Sundays of Advent will focus on the Lords Second Coming while the last Sunday from Dec 17th onward will focus on our preparation to celebrate His birth on Christmas Day The entire Advent Season is meant to challenge us and calls us to conversion We are being tasked with preparing our hearts to truly be prepared to welcome Jesus Christ into the world and into our lives To assist in this call to conversion we as a parish have several resources and opportunities available Our Little Blue Books available in English and Spanish and a variety of Advent Calendars are available in the narthex For charitable outreach we are participating in both the Blessing Tree which is already underway and an Advent Food Drive to support the Wells County Food Bank For prayer join us this week for our Praise and Worship Holy Hour on Wednesday Dec 1st from 6 7 PM and First Friday Adoration on Friday Dec 3rd from 9 AM 6 PM What better way to enter into this Advent Season than by spending time with our Lord in Adoration ECEMBER LANNING OLY AYS AND HRISTMAS Though Advent is only beginning it doesnt hurt to look ahead and plan for upcoming Holy Days and Mass obligations The Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception a Holy Day of Obligation on Wednesday Dec 8th We will offer four different Mass times on this day vigil Mass on Tuesday Dec 7th at 5:30PM and Masses on Wednesday Dec 8th at 7:00AM Noon and 7:00PM with Choir As Christmas Day falls on a Saturday this year we find ourselves in a unique situation Christmas is always a Holy Day of Obligation and being one of the holiest days in our entire liturgical year this obligation is never transferred to another day This means that we are called to attend and assist at two separate Masses between December 24th 26th one for our yearly Christmas obligation and the other for our weekly Sunday obligation Please see the included handout with Mass times to help guide you in discerning how to best fulfill these two obligations for the Lord For Christmas there will be several different Mass times offered to allow us to welcome guests and help prevent overcrowding at any individual Mass On Friday Dec 24th the Vigil Masses will be at 4 PM 6 PM and Midnight and on Saturday Dec 25th Mass will be at 9 AM At 4 PM we will bless our Nativity Scene At 6 PM our Adult and Children Choir will lead us in song Join the Choir for Christmas Carols at 5:30PM prior to the 6 PM Mass At Midnight Mass will be offered by Christmas lights and candlelight Faithfully in Christ Fr David Please Note Incense may be used at these specific Mass times MASS INTENTIONS Saturday November 27 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Children of Tom
