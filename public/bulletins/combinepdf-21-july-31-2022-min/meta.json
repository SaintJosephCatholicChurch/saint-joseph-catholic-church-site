  "text": "Eighteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 31 2022 We thank Fr John Sheehan SJ for being with us these past seven weeks Quite appropriately Fr John's last weekend with us falls on the Feast of St Ignatius of Loyola one of the founders of the Society of Jesus May our good Lord through the intercession of St Ignatius continue to bless Fr John in his continued ministry This weekend July 30th 31st the Church celebrates the Eighteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Throughout the remainder of Ordinary Time we will continue to hear that which is essential to the Christian life proclaimed through our readings Having heard how to pray now we hear how to live Through reliance on God This theme will continue over the next many weekends as we are told of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ Friends in Heaven In addition to the Feast of St Ignatius of Loyola our own diocese also celebrated the Memorial of Bl Solanus Casey OFM just this past Saturday July 30th Bl Solanus was a Capuchin Franciscan who lived from 1946 to 1956 at St Felix Friary in Huntington He was well known even by some of our own parishioners for his humble ministry wise counsel and example of trust in God Beatified by Pope Francis in 2017 the miraculous healing of a genetic skin condition for a retired teaching from Panama was attributed to Bl Solanus's intercession If a second miracle is attributed to his intercession he will be canonized or recognized as a Saint and his feast day will be celebrated throughout the world Until that time we remain one of only four dioceses in the world that celebrates Bl Solanus yearly memorial at Mass Eucharistic Miracles As it is the last weekend of July this will be our last bulletin cover focused specifically on Eucharistic Miracles As both June and July are months dedicated to the Body and Blood of our Lord I hope that you found these covers adapted from the work of Bl Carlo Acutis both edifying and fruitful The gift of the Holy Eucharist is often something easily taken for granted Though a Eucharistic Miracle is not an event that requires our belief it is an event given by the Lord to assist our belief And as we saw over these past many weeks our Lord has used such moments throughout history time and again to remind us of this simple truth My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink John 655 In receiving our Eucharistic Lord we are united to the sacrifice of the Cross and to the heavenly Banquet that awaits Catechism of the Catholic Church Para 1382 Returning from Washington DC I look forward to seeing you all next weekend at Mass I will be returning to our parish at the beginning of this week and settling back in at the rectory With this summer I have now completed the four years of coursework that is necessary for the licentiate degree in canon law While the summer proved quite busy with studies and did not allow for much tourism I did greatly enjoy the chance to reconnect with my classmates in person and to meet the new students in the program Starting this Fall I will begin work on my thesis to complete the licentiate degree Thankfully the majority of the thesis can be completed online I will however be planning a week long return trip to Washington DC sometime soon to gather research materials and to meet with my thesis advisor For this thesis I am planning to look at the concept of parish registration as it is followed in the United States Parish registration is itself a fairly new concept in the life of the Church and has not yet been enshrined in Her laws Faithfully in Christ Fr
