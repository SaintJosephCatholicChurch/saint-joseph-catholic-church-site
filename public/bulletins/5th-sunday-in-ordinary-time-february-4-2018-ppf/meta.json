2018 Homily by Msgr Joseph Pellegrino This material is used with permission of its author Msgr Joseph Pellegrino Diocese St Petersburg FL It is important that we know his name His name is Vinicio Riva Knowing his name keeps us from focusing on his ailment He is not a disease He is a person So who is Vinicio Riva Vinicio is a 53 year old man from the Northern Italian town of Vincenza who suffers from a noninfectious genetic disease neurofibromatosis type 1 It has left him completely covered from head to toe with growths swellings and itchy sores Vinicios condition has resulted in many people pushing him to the fringe of society He has been told not to sit by people on a bus He can only do the most me nial work Vinicio traveled with members of his family and others from North Italy to Rome They secured tickets to the Papal audience When the Swiss Guard saw him they ushered him to the front row Pope Francis came in gave his talk then went down to greet some of the infirm He saw Vinicio and walked over to him The Pope then kissed the sores on this poor mans face Vinicio the outcast has now become a celebrity More than that his value has been affirmed by the Pope himself And Jesus heals Scores of people pushed against Jesus They wanted to be healed Jesus knew that sickness was not part of the Fathers plan These people were suffering the result of mans choosing death over life choosing to push God aside in favor of the material world They were innocent as individuals but they all suffered from mankinds guilt Jesus heart went out to them He hurt for them He healed them One of the Lords new disciples Simon Peter had sickness in his family His motherinlaw was suffering from a fever That might not seem like much to us but in those days the infection that caused the fever would often kill the person Jesus raised her up the fever left her and she served the Lord Here are two more scenes from the Gospels two of many that I could present man is sitting under a tree a fig tree His name is Nathaniel Perhaps he is contem plating the world and his own insignificance Perhaps he is suffering from his lack of selfworth Then Jesus calls him Nathaniel becomes someone a disciple then an apostle He goes to Jesus and proclaims him to be the Son of God Jesus has healed him Young people and all of us who have bouts of suffering from low selfesteem we need to go to Jesus He sees us for whom we are a daughter a son of God We are temples of the Holy Spirit With our eyes focused on the Lord we are healed of our own self doubts The second scene from the Gospel is the one about Zacchaeus You know his story Zacchaeus was that diminutive tax collector scorned by Jewish society He heard a commotion Jesus was walking down the road with his disciples Hundreds of people were crowding around him To get a better look Zacchaeus climbed a tree Jesus saw Zacchaeus saw how the tax collectors sins were destroying him and with all those people around all those people who wanted a second of His attention Jesus announced that he would stay that night in Zacchaeus house Zacchaeus re nounced his former life and promised to repay all he had defrauded Jesus healed What sins do we have that Jesus will not heal Pope Francis reminds us that God refuses to run out of mercy It is we who shut his mercy off from our lives Jesus heals We depend on the expertise of our medical people Doctors and dentists nurses and all those in the medical field spend many years learning their professions Then they spend a great deal of time developing their skills We sometimes take them for granted They are not just medical people They are the healing hands of Christ But doctors are limited in what they can do That brings me to this scene Parents sit by their childs bed in the hospital Nothing in life could be worse Their child is dy ing They are praying for a cure But through it all they place their complete trust in Jesus And they know that no matter what happens their child will remain in Jesus hands In this way Jesus heals them Many of us have also been very sick We have wondered if this is it Will this ailment take us now or eventually The human part of us is afraid But the spiritual part of us reminds us that the One who sweat blood as his death approached knows how we feel And we also trust in Him And Jesus heals Jesus heals He heals the pain not just of the people of the past but the pain of the people of today Some receive physical healing immediately Others receive healing in stages Some receive a clear miracle All who call out to the Lord are healed Some are healed physically Some are healed emotionally able to accept their condition in life The amount needed each week to make budget is 511640 We are 36462 behind budget from last week and 90164 ahead for

plagued Job He is there to give us the courage to walk with Him over the threshold to a new life In essence we are all Vinicio Riva We may not have his exter nal scars but we all have scars Jesus sees our scars He is not re pulsed by them He embraces our scars in an infinitely greater way than Pope Francis embraced Vinicios scars He embraces us He heals us Jesus heals The light of God surrounds me
