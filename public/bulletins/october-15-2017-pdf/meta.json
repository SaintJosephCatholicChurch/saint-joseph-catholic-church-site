EACH OF US IS INVITED TO COME TO THE BANQUET OF THE LORD My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all This month of Octo ber is a month for Our Lady and St Joseph our Noble Patron saint So I am encour aging you to pray the Rosary more than you have been praying Redeemer Radio is one of the most powerful means of spreading the good of the Gos pel of Our Lord Jesus Christ It helps greatly to fulfill the mandate of spreading the Gospel through New Evangelization Any time you tune in to Redeemer Radio you will learn something new or you are reminded of something you have forgotten It is amazing Our Bishop Most Rev Kevin Rhoades teaches through the Redeemer Radio every Wednesday by noon It also hooks to EWTN Radio and Television Listen to Redeemer Radio while you prepare your meals in the Kitchen while shaving or doing something in your house while driving to work etc Thus to continue to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Redeemer Radio it organizes SHARATHON Fund Raiser in Spring and Fall thus inviting parishes to participate In view of this Msgr Pius Ilechukwu and the Knights of Columbus will chair One Hour of SHARATHONFund Raiser for Redeemer Radio on October 26 from 6:00pm to 7:00pm on behalf of our parish Every Parishioner is encour aged to participate by calling and supporting the SHARATHONFund Raiser Give any kind of support you wish No amount is too small or too big Tunein to1063 FM Northeast Indiana or 957 FM Michiana for South Bend area and call on that day and support the spreading of the Good News of the Kingdom of God Thanks for support ing God bless you and all your loved ones In todays Readings The three readings talk on food banquet and enjoyment especially the First Reading and the Gospel So food drink and enjoyment are important in our lives We go to parties to enjoy ourselves to meet one another and feel happy To attend a party or banquet can be the beginning of a beautiful friendships and relationships or strengthening an existing relationship lot can happen at a party Thus in the 1st Reading Is 25610a God is inviting each of us to his banquet Ban quet or breaking of bread You know eating with a person is a Biblical sign of love and intimate friendship If we accept Gods invitation he will wipe tears of suffering pains and sadness from our eyes and remove the veil that prevented us from seeing him and being saved The banquet will be on a mountain This shows that we need to struggle and strive to climb the mountain That means that we must try our best to behave well and be holy To climb the mountain means to endure suffering for the sake of the Kingdom of God It means to strive and persevere in doing good and avoiding evil In the Gospel Mt 22114 or 22110 We may be embarrassed by the treatment given to one of the guests in the banquet hall by the king He told his servant Go out therefore into the main roads and invite to the feast whomever you find Since those who were in vited did not come The guests were not given opportunity to go home and dress well and come back Even those in the farms were also asked to go to the banquet hall However let us look at the situation this way Yes everybody was invited but we need to do some petty things to fit in If we ask people to come into this Church anyone coming from any nearby farm should at least on entering this Church will go to the rest room at the back of the Church remove his or her gloves and wash his or her hands And then join the rest In Jewish culture those who come to weeding feast receive wedding garments at the door of the hall Everybody receives it freely Why did the man come into the hall without the wedding garment He failed to do the very little thing he should have done We all are invited by God to the banquet of the Holy Eucharist We know that we should be prepared to receive and we know what to do As the king in the Gospel came in to meet the quests so is Jesus here to meet each of us But in a unique way He meets us as we queue to receive the Holy Eucharist Let us be prepared for the Holy Eucharist As one who needs to wash hands at the rest room to fit to join so also someone may need to enter the Confes sional room to wash to fit to receive So let us always be prepared so that we will not be embarrassed at the banquet hall or at the gate of heaven NB 1 We are organizing Marriage
