Time November 10 2024 This weekend November 9th 10th the Church celebrates the Thirty second Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings are meant to give us powerful lessons in faith as we spend the month pondering the Last Things Death Judgment Heaven Hell and preparing for the celebration of Christ the King In faith we do not fear that which lies ahead but like the Lord Himself are called to give of ourselves entirely in service to God and neighbor As a nation we also celebrate Veterans Day on Monday Nov 11th This annual memorial originally named Armistice Day to mark the end of the First World War is a day in which we show our gratitude and pray for those who have defended our country and kept peace throughout the world May we continue to implore the Lord to protect all the men and women serving our country and for peace in all places of strife Parish Trivia Night Tuesday November 19th Join us on Tuesday November 19th at 6:30PM for Parish Trivia Night at Parlor City Brewery You are invited to participate in teams of two as we go through a variety of trivia topics Please see the sign up in the Narthex to sign up your teams Food and drink will be available for purchase We are working with the brewery to have a menu available ahead of time for pre ordering Forty Hours Devotion Our parish's Forty Hours Devotion will help us enter into Advent this year Beginning on Monday Dec 2nd with Mass at 7 PM our parish family enters into an extended period of Eucharistic Adoration On Tuesday Dec 3rd we will have sung Vespers the evening prayer of the Church at 6:30PM and hear an exhilarating eucharistic conference at 7 PM Finally we will conclude with Mass on Wednesday Dec 4th at 7 PM Throughout this time the Blessed Sacrament will be exposed in the Church at all hours night and day As meaningful as our scheduled events will be it is this time between the events that are perhaps most important It is in these moments that you are being invited to spend time before our Eucharistic Lord Himself It is here in these moments of silence before Him where the Lord will speak to our hearts and we will be most prepared to hear His voice Please see the sign up sheet and consider making this sacrifice for the Lord The Liturgy of the Eucharist The Rite of Peace Having proclaimed together God as our Father we now express this unity as God's children through the Rite of Peace The sign of peace exchanged during Mass is a gesture where the Church implores peace and unity for Herself and for the whole human family This desire is itself reflected in the very act as the Faithful express to each other their communion and mutual charity in preparation to approach the Holy Eucharist Peace I leave you my peace I give you John 1427 With these words Jesus promises the gift of peace to His Apostles before facing His passion After His resurrection our Lord fulfills this promise by appearing among His Apostles saying Peace be with you John 2019 Truly Christ's peace is the fruit that He has brought into the world by His death and resurrection a gift that continues to be given every time we gather for the Eucharistic celebration Let us offer each other the sign of peace These words spoken by the Priest invite us to make the ritual expression of the sign of peace at Mass We are invited to do so in a way which safeguards the sacred sense of the Eucharistic celebration May we always invoke preach and spread not a worldly peace but the peace of the Risen Lord in the celebration of the Mass by means of this human gesture lifted up to the realm of the sacred Thank you to all who made our All Saints Day and All Souls Day events a success special Thank You to Lauren Andrews and our Parish Staff for organizing our annual All Saints Day Party and to our Knights of
