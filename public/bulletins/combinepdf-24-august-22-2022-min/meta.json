  "text": " Twenty - First Sunday in Ordinary Time   -   August 21, 2022  This weekend (August 20 th /21 st ), the Church celebrates the   Twenty - first  Sunday in Ordinary Time . Next weekend, we have a number of events going  on. After all Masses next weekend, you will have the chance to register with  the parish, update any registration information that is out - of - date, learn about  our various parish groups, and sign - up for any number of ministries that are  offered or are being renewed.  On Saturday (Aug. 27 th ), we are hosting a Pizza Party and Ice Cream Bar in  the Parish Social Hall for all families registering for our Religious Education  Program (Grades K - 12 th ). This is not only a chance to register for Religious  Education, but also to meet your child ’ s catechists for the coming year. On  Sunday (Aug. 28 th ), our Knights of Columbus is partnering with the Red Cross  for a Blood Drive from 7 AM to 12:30 PM in the Parish Social Hall.  Church Lighting  A special   “ Thank You! ”   to parishioners Corey Coulardot and Andy Vachon for  help in changing lights throughout the Church this week. The light fixtures in  the nave have all been fitted with new LED bulbs. Utilizing alternating color  temperature   bulbs   in   our   downlighting   and   uplighting,   the   Church   will  maintain a soft ambience throughout the day for quiet prayer while also  ensuring that the nave remains well lit throughout Mass.  Parish Playground  After several unavoidable delays, our new playground equipment is in the  process of being installed. With the equipment cemented into the ground, new  turf is being laid throughout this week. If everything remains on schedule, the  equipment and area will be safe and open for use in the coming week. Once  the area is ready for use, we look forward to having a formal blessing of the  equipment to open the area.  Summer Reading Program  Our   St. Francis Summer Reading Program   had nearly twenty of our  youth participating ( and a number of adults! ) and resulted in well over 5,000+  pages read throughout the summer. Our Grand Prize Bucket went to   Bella S.  as one of our top readers. Each youth who participated and returned their  reading sheets at the end of the summer will receive a participation certificate,  signed by myself and Bishop Rhoades. Upon learning of our summer program,  Bishop shared with me how glad he was that we started this program. A  special   “ Thank You! ”   to all those who helped to organize and volunteered to  help make this program happen.  Did You Know? Holy Water  A Sacrament is an outward sign instituted by Jesus Christ to give grace. A  sacramental, on the other hand, is anything set apart or blessed by the Church  to excite good thoughts, to increase devotion, and to point us towards the  Sacraments and Jesus Christ. Holy water is, arguably, the most well known  sacramental from the Catholic Church. As a sacramental, it points us towards  the Sacrament of Baptism. Every time we sign our foreheads with holy water,  we are reminded of our holy baptismal promises and of the obligation then  undertaken: to keep our souls pure and clean from sin.  The use of Holy Water in the Catholic Church is a time - honored custom. In  the first centuries, it was usual to sprinkle the faithful with holy water in Mass.  Church Fathers in the 4th Century make mention of a basin or other receptacle  containing holy water which stood at the entrance of churches for the use of  the Faithful. In the 5th Century, St. John Chrysostom relates that the Faithful  used to take holy water to their houses and keep it throughout the year. Even  today, when we enter the Church building, we are invited to take holy water  from the font which is placed at the door and mark ourselves with the sign of  the cross.   This reminds us of our baptism and that we are called to approach  the throne of the Most High with a soul free from sin.   ~Faithfully in Christ, Fr.
