  "text": "ECOND UNDAY OF ENT EBRUARY 28 2021 As we enter into the Second Sunday of Lent February 27th 28th we join our Blessed Lord as He ascends Mount Tabor with Peter James and John And upon this holy mountain these three Apostles witness the glory of God as Jesus is transfigured before them Mark 9210 In this moment Jesus briefly reveals His divine glory and confirms the confession made by Peter short moments before Mark 82730 This overwhelming experience of Gods manifest glory serves to encourage these Apostles for the difficult journey that lies ahead Immediately following Peters confession Jesus offers the first prediction of His coming Passion and states that His followers would also have to carry His cross Mark 83133 From hearing these challenging words to seeing Jesus transfigured the Apostles begin to understand that it is necessary for us to undergo many hardships to enter the kingdom of God Acts 1422 And just as quickly as they climbed Mount Tabor so they descended from the heights The next mountain that they shall approach is Mount Calvary upon which our Blessed Lord will once again ascend and be lifted up in glory This next time however His glory will not be shown in the transfiguration but will be revealed upon the Cross For it is on that very same Cross on which hung the salvation of the world LTAR ERVER RAINING AND PDATES Last weekend we offered a refresher session for 19 of our altar servers This weekend we are offering a training session for all those in 4th12th Grade who are interested in becoming altar servers Beginning this
