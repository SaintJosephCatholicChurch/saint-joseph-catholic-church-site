Lochtefeld THIRD SUNDAY OF EASTER APRIL 15 2018 YR LORD OPEN OUR MINDS TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND YOUR WORD My dear brothers and sisters in Christ the Lord be with you My dear people of God we need to strive and struggle to know and understand the Word of God Every human person is born TABULA RASA smooth tablet without impression on it except what God Himself wrote on it His Laws It is important therefore that parents and guardians who are supposed to be the first people to help a child have something writ ten on the virgin conscience Then as the child grows it is obvious that heshe should make effort to continue to have something written in himher Please children and young people listen Thus a youngster overcomes ignorance gathers knowledge and attains insight and understanding by making some effort to learn You need to listen to your parents to the Church to your teachers and your elders You need knowledge to attain insight Do you hear me my dear young people Now to everybody Todays readings deal with ignorance And the worst ignorance is culpable ignorance and more so when it is spiritual culpable ignorance Culpable Ignorance is ignorance of what we should ordinarily know It a blamable ignorance because it is a result of ones laziness In the First Reading Acts 31315 1719 Peter blamed the Jews for killing the au thor of life the Holy One the Lord Jesus Christ He said You denied the Holy and Righteous One The author of life you put him to death but God raised him from the dead I know brothers that you acted out of ignorance just as your leaders did So Ignorance on the part of those who should know is blamable and it causes harm and disaster Poorly informed Catholics though they may hold doctorate degree in different areas of specialization are danger to themselves and to others In the second Reading 1 Jn 215a St John said I am writing this to you so that you may not sin The way we may be sure that we know him is to keep his com mandments Those who say we know him but do not keep his commandments are liars There is a great difference between knowing about your friend and knowing him her To really know involves love The more you know the more you love and the more you love the more you know someone Thus we need to know God Not just to know about God Then in the Gospel Lk 243548St Luke told us that the two disciples whom the Lord met on their way to Emmaus were narrating their experiences how they came to recognize the Lord Jesus at the breaking of bread And while they were speaking the Lord Jesus stood in their midst Then he said to them Peace be with you But they were startled He said to them Why are you troubled These are my words that I spoke to you that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and in the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures To know and understand God we must read the bible Catholic books and newspapers and other good books To experience GodJesus Christ in meditative and prayerful bible reading is the clue to Christian renewal For it is in prayer that we encounter GodJesus and experience him for our salvation LORD OPEN OUR MINDS TO

shows that most abuse is committed by someone who has gained the trust of a victimsurvivor and hisher family With child sexual abuse sixty percent of the time the offender is a family friend acquaintance or another trusted adult in the victimsurvivors life Thirty percent of the time the offender is a family member Sometimes an offender seems like the nicest person in the world but this is often part of a process they use called grooming in order to gain the trust of the child they wish to abuse and the trust of hisher 7th GRADE HAITIAN HOUSE FUNDRAISER The 7th Grade Class is organizing
