the Pastors Desk FIDELITY TO COMMITMENT REQUIRES COURAGE DEDICATION CONSTANCY AND PERCEVERANCE THUS WE ARE CALLED TO BE FAITHFUL TO OUR COMMITMENT AS CATHOLIC CHRISTIANS My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all Remember that we continue to pray in a unique way for our departed loved ones in this month of No vember Pray for them Book Masses for them For our reflections this week When you make a commitment it colors your modus Vivendi your way of living We made some commitments with God and the Lord Je sus Christ at our Baptism We need to be faithful dedicated committed courageous and constant and to persevere in fulfilling our commitment with God Thus in the 1st Reading Prv 311013 1920 3031 The book of the Proverbs ad monished women wives and mothers to be committed in their marriage Let every mother wife ask herself Am I a worthy mother wife entrusting my heart to my husband Sometime today let every mother wife reread the First Reading of todays Holy Mass Proverbs 311013 1920 3031 and meditates on it It will help you to be a good mother God meant you to be Please Men help the ladies to read the passage In the 2nd Reading 1 Thes 516 Paul is warning us to be vigilant committed for we do not know when the Son of God will come As children of God we are the chil dren of light we must be awake waiting for the quiet calm and secret coming of the Lord Be prepared How It is simple Be In State Of Grace Be a good person In the gospel Mt 251430 every one of us has received some talents from God Ask yourself how faithful and committed have you been to the talents God gave you Look we must be faithful and be committed to it or to them This parable is all about the com ingthe return of the Lord Jesus Christ 2 times but really 3 times When he comes will he find you ready and vigilant Reflect on these and tell yourself the truth about your condition your relationship with God and your neighbor The Lord will come to judge the entire world Each of us will give account of the talents God has given to us Never you be like the third servant Rather let us work hard like the first and the second servants who persevered were committed faithful vigilant and constant They strived succeeded and were saved and rewarded Be generous with the talents God gave you It is given to you for yourself your family and others So strive to be saved NB 1 We
