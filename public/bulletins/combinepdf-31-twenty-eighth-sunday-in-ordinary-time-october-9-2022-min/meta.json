  "text": "Twenty Eighth Sunday in Ordinary Time October 9 2022 special Thank You to all those who helped to make our parish picnic such a success especially our Parish Council and Michelle in our Parish Office And of course a special Thank You to all those who came out and enjoyed a fantastic afternoon together growing in Christian fraternity New and strengthened friendships help us to support one another as brothers and sisters in Christ This weekend October 8th 9th the Church celebrates the Twenty eighth Sunday in Ordinary Time It is also our kickoff for the Annual Bishop's Appeal Thank you to everyone who has already submitted your pledge and for those who have not yet had an opportunity to do so thank you for prayerfully considering the way that the Lord is calling you to sacrificial generosity in support of our local Church Our most important target is to have 100 participation The Annual Bishop's Appeal is critical for the financial health not only of our Diocese but also of our parish Any amount raised over our goal of 4387590 will be returned to our parish Thanks to last year's overage in addition to the fundraising done by our Knights of Columbus and GIRL's Night Out we were able to install and dedicate our new parish playground just a few weeks ago This year's overage keeping to our Eucharistic theme will be put towards the dedication of an altar in our cemetery To be placed at the center of the cemetery this altar will serve as a visible reminder of the unity we share with our dearly departed loved ones when we are united in worship together through the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass This coming week the priests of our diocese will gather for our yearly Continuing Education Days at Pokagon State Park This year our continuing education will be focused on the three year Eucharistic Revival in the United States Our presenters will be Bishop Andrew Cozzens the national chairman for the Eucharistic Revival and Dr Timothy Malley professor of Sacramental Theology at the University of Notre Dame Because of the Continuing Education Days there will be no daily Mass this week on Wednesday 7 PM Thursday 8 AM or Saturday 8 AM There will be Mass this Friday 8:30AM with Fr Steve Colchin serving as celebrant In addition we will welcome Fr Dave Ruppert pastor of St Mary's in Decatur as the celebrant of our Masses next weekend I will in turn be spending the weekend traveling with my brother for a few days of vacation Parish Directory Having been seven years since our last Parish Directory was published we have begun the work to create a new directory in the coming weeks and months Differing from previous directories this Parish Directory will be put together entirely in house through the volunteer efforts of parishioners At the end of this month and throughout November we will have three different weekends for parishioners to have their picture taken for the Parish Directory Pictures will be taken after Masses in the Parish Conference Room The pictures will only be used for our Parish Directory Picture dates are the weekends of Oct 29th 30th Nov 5th 6th and Nov 11th 12th More to come Special Tithe Hurricane Ian and Fiona Next weekend a portion of our weekend collection will be tithed to support disaster relief and aid for those affected by Hurricanes Ian and Fiona This charitable donation from our parish made at the request of Bishop Rhoades will be put towards the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Emergency Disaster Fund This fund directly supports the work of Catholic Charities USA and Catholic Relief Services
