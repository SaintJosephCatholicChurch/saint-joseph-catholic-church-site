Administrative AssistantDRE Michelle Paxton Prayer for Those Recovering from Natural Disasters Merciful God The natural world is both wondrous and terrifying It can tear away homes and neighborhoods and leave lost and bereft those whose lives have been upended Such is the case now Throughout the ages people have turned to you in times of devastation and heartbreak You turned your heart towards them and did not abandon them Let your presence now be known by those who have lost so much in the face of this natural disaster Hurricane Dorian Bring them comfort and relief and offer consolation in the midst of desolation Make those of us untouched by this disaster mindful of their needs and generous in our response In the rebuilding that must take place draw us together in mutual love and support In your gracious name we pray Amen MASS INTENTIONS Saturday September 7 8:00am No Mass Intention 8:30am Rosary 4:00pm Confessions 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm David Paul Butler Sunday September 8

IN ORDINARY TIME September 8 2019 Year Our readings this weekend continue the theme of the difficulty and cost of disci pleship from Lukes Gospel St Luke a physician Colossians 414 and disciple of St Paul 2 Timothy 411 is writing to a largely Greek and Gentile Christian audience In writing to Theophilius Luke 114 and others like him theophilius meaning Friend of God St Luke is seeking to strengthen the confidence they have found in the Faith that they have received As St Paul and most likely the Blessed Virgin has done for him he desires to introduce each reader of his gospel to the risen Christ and to call them to deepen our personal relationship with Him Speaking to the crowd physically following after Him in our Gospel today Luke142533 Jesus challenges them to not only follow after Him on foot but also in their hearts As we have heard over the past several weeks He seeks to set their hearts on fire Luke 1249 and prepare them for the difficult path of disci pleship Luke 132230 Humbling ourselves before the Lord Luke 14714 we are called to dedicate ourselves to Him entirely Luke 142533 If we seek to be disciples nothing can hold us back from the love of Christ The call to the crowd today is made to each of us Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple Following after the Lord requires trusting in His plan even when we may not fully see the road ahead In our second reading Philemon 1910 1217St Paul writes from prison Sent out to preach the gospel evangelion or good news being bound in prison would seem to prevent this Yet it does not stop St Paul as he continues to write to the Churches that he has founded No matter the situation he has found himself in he continues the mission he has been given however he is able to do so As reiterated in our first reading Wisdom 91318 God has set a plan for us Even if we cannot see or understand it fully yet it is there As we approach a new week may we renew our commitment in following the Lord This means following Him in all things and at every moment In those times when we fail may we seek His forgiveness through the Sacrament of Confession and pick up our cross anew As Mother Angelica founder of Eternal Word Tele vision Network EWTN is famous for saying Holiness is not for wimps and the cross is not negotiable sweetheart its a requirement To follow after the Lord is not an easy path It leads to Calvary But if we are willing to see it through we will see that it doesnt end at Calvary Instead we can glimpse the joy of paradise and heavenly beatitude that lies beyond The heavenly Jerusalem that awaits Are we willing to trust and follow after the Lord today and everyday no matter the path that lies ahead Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF SEPTEMBER
