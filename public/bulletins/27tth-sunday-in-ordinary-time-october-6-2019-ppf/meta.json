SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME October 6 2019 Next weekend we will resume our monthly discussion forum between Sunday morn ing Masses Ive asked our Youth Group to suggest topics for the coming months and they responded with many great suggestions For October our discussion fo rum will focus on The Saints This is a very important topic to understand in our Faith as there are so many misconceptions about our relationships with the Saints Dont Catholics worship Saints Arent Statues and Images of the Saints a form of idolatry etc In better understanding and fostering our relationships with the Saints we are able to grow even deeper in our relationship with the Lord All are welcome to join us for this discussion next Sunday Oct 13th be tween the 730 and 10 AM Masses in the Social Hall We will also repeat the fo rum on Wendesday Oct 16th following the 7 PM Wednesday evening Mass in the Social Hall for those who cannot join us in between Masses I encourage you to invite family and friends along who may have questions regarding the Catholic Faith and the Saints Two weeks ago we had a chance to look at what the Priest wears outside of the Liturgy Today and next week we will have the chance to look at what the Priest wears during the Liturgy specifically at Mass Of the many garments the Priest wears the most outer garments worn during Mass are the Stole and the Chasuble The Stole is a band of colored cloth worn under the Chasuble as a sign of the Sacra ment of Holy Orders It serves as a symbol of the authority of Jesus Christ and the Priest acting in persona Christi capitas in the person of Christ the Head is reminded by it of his role as a servant leader to the Faithful The Chasuble is worn over the Stole as the outermost garment and is a sign of the love of Christ that covers and binds all things together Colossians 314 The color of the vestments changes with each Liturgical Season Right now we remain in Ordinary Time until the new Liturgical Year begins this Advent In Ordinary Time the vestments are green to represent hope and growth just as the green buds of trees and flowers in the springtime signify new life and growth Throughout the remainder of the Liturgical Year walking alongside the life of Christ we also see whitegold at Christmas and Easter representing joy red at Pente cost Good Friday and the Feast of Martyrs representing both the Holy Spirit and the Passion and violet at Advent and Lent representing penance and preparation Note Black is also a liturgical color seen on All Souls Day and if requested at funerals to represent loss and mourning Ordinary Time is the longest of the liturgical seasons lasting 34 weeks each year The first several weeks of Ordinary Time occur after the Christmas Season until the beginning of Lent on Ash Wednesday During this time we meditate upon the quiet years of the life of our Lord from His birth to the beginning of His public min istry The remainder of Ordinary Time follows the end of the Easter Season and continues until the end of the Liturgical Year with the Feast of Christ the King reminding us that all things begin and end in Christ During this time we mediate upon the growth and spreading of the Church which is the Body of Christ here on earth following the Ascension of our Lord and His Great Commission Matthew 2819 20 Next weekend we will have the chance to look at a personal green vestment of mine that we will be using on Sundays in Ordinary Time Several months ago I commissioned a personal vestment from a local seamstress Mrs Mary Muhlenkamp of Geneva Mary is the mother of Fr Ben Muhlenkamp pastor of St Louis Besan con in New Haven and has a wonderful ministry of sewing vestments to be used in the Liturgy for the greater glory of God Wanting to support Mary in this ministry I personally commissioned a green vestment in memory of my late grandparents Rocco Margaret and William Johana As withal things liturgical there is much symbol ism and meaning put into this vestment that I look forward to sharing this with you in next weeks bulletin column Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF OCTOBER 1213 2019 CANTORS 500 Marita Crawfis 730 Donna Geisel
