Mt 935 1015a68 Sun Dec 8 Second Sunday of Advent Is 11110 Rom 1549 Mt 3112 FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT December 1 2019 To all those who are visiting this weekend from the Thanksgiving holiday welcome to St Josephs Know that you are always welcome here As you head home may our Blessed Lord keep you safe in your travels To all of our college students back for the weekend welcome home Know of our prayers for you over this next month as you prepare to finish another semester Throughout our Thanksgiving holiday we often have the chance to reflect upon and thank God for the many blessings and graces in our lives This year as every year I thank our Blessed Lord for each of you It is my joy to be here at St Josephs as your pastor and I am looking forward to another wonderful year with our parish family Today the Church begins a new liturgical year and enters the holy season of Advent Throughout the next four weeks we are called to open our hearts and allow our Blessed Lord to transform them Included in this bulletin is an insert from the Ukranian Catholic Bishops to the faithful in the United States Our Eastern Catholics brothers and sisters began the season of Pylypivka or Advent earlier this past month I would encourage you to read and meditate upon the words of these shepherds to the Church as we enter into this holy season They remind us of the need to seek out silence amidst the secular world and to prepare the way of the Lord in our hearts Remember a great Christmas begins first with an incredible Advent Making Advent more about preparation for Christs coming often doesnt mean doing something else More often it actually means doing less and going about our day with a different spirit and focus Over the next four weeks I encourage you to find Christ anew each day in our lives Make extra time for prayer each day If you are able commit to attending an additional daily Mass each week Stop in the Church during our times of Adoration and Confession or at any time to find rest for our hearts before the Lord Remember to attend our Advent Penance Service on Thursday Dec 19th from 630730 PM The best gift we can give to Jesus for Christmas is the gift of our conversion and the best way for us to receive this gift from Jesus is in the sacramental form in which He wishes to give it Let us not let these four weeks pass us by Next Sunday Dec 8th the Church would normally celebrate the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception However as this is also the 2nd Sunday of Advent the United States Bishop Conference has transferred the solemnity to Monday Dec 9th As the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception is transferred it is not a Holy Day of Obligation this year Still as Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception is the patroness of our country we will offer two Masses on Monday 8 AM and 5:30PM to celebrate this great day All are welcome to join us Also though we will not celebrate the Solemnity on the day itself Sunday Dec 8th that shouldnt stop us from celebrating Every Sunday is a day worth celebrating as we celebrate the Resurrection of the Lord To help us in our celebration there will be juice and donuts following the Sunday morning Masses 730 and 10 AM next weekend Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF DECEMBER 78 2019 CANTORS 500 Jay Crisp 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Sophia Emrah LECTORS 500 Knights of Columbus 730 Barb

the liturgical year The liturgical year is not simply how we mark the passage of time in the church calendar year The liturgical year tells the story of Gods life in the world a story in which we are participants not just spectators or listeners It is a reliving of the life of Christ His Most Holy Mother and the Saints And liturgy is the means by which we tell live and experience the story Through liturgy it becomes real to us and becomes part of our own lives It has been said that liturgy is humanitys yearning for God and that grace is Gods yearning for humanity Liturgically this story of holy yearning Gods yearning for us and our yearning for God begins at the point in the liturgical year that we find ourselves at the present moment Advent the four week period of waiting and watching for the fulfillment of Gods promises and the coming together of humanity and divinity in the Christ child who with his nativity will bring new life and new hope into our world and our lives Too often we see this time of Advent through the secular lens of our modern postChristian society as the final countdown to Christmas the time when we get things ready for the holidays By now the malls and stores have long been decorated for Christmas Christmas gift lists are growing and the number of shopping days is shrinking Party menus are being planned Travel plans are being made Families are gathering Expectations and hopes are growing Christmas trees need decorating and presents need wrapping The pressure is mounting There is so much to do and so little time to do it in We feel stressed and distracted This is not the liturgical or spiritual understanding of Advent proposed by the Church This is not the ideal way of spending this holy time Advent is not the time when we prepare for Christmas It is the time in which we are prepared for Christmas It is the time not so much for action as for reflection a time not for doing but for being open and receptive Advent is the time when the Church offers to us an alternative to the secular model of getting ready for the holidays and asks us to slow down be still and be quiet We are called to keep awake to be looking and listening for the God who is coming to us We are called to prepare the way of the Lord in our hearts It is a time to watch and reflect on who we are It is a time to look for Christ in all the unexpected places in the ordinary events of everyday life in the poor the hungry and the needy And we wait and watch for the angelic messenger who will tell us of the birth of the Christ child Being still and keeping attentive is hard work at any time but especially now during one of the busiest times of the year so full of distractions and stress which makes keeping still and attentive even more necessary for us The time of Advent reminds us that waiting and watching is holy work So how do we do this The tradition of the Church teaches us that silence is the key Silence is a way of waiting a way of watching and a way of listening to what is going on within and around us Through stillness and silence through attentiveness and watchfulness we come to selfknowledge and the true spiritual meaning of the coming of Christ Of course it is unrealistic for us to completely detach ourselves from the world in which we live Our daily obligations and responsibilities prevent us from doing so However during this time of Advent we encourage you to take just a few minutes each day to sit in silence and stillness with perhaps the aid of Holy Scripture or a spiritual book and meditate on the coming of the Lord in the flesh in the feast of His Nativity If you do this be prepared to be surprised at what the Lord might whisper to you in your heart May the blessings of the Lord Jesus whose birth we joyfully await descend upon all of you"
