  "text": "Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion April 10 2022 Congratulations again to our Confirmandi Class of 2022 Charlie Philip Spencer Alex Adison Addison and Abby who were confirmed by Bishop Rhoades this past Friday special Thank You to their families and our many catechesis who have aided in their formation throughout the years Did You Know Holy Week and the Sacred Paschal Triduum Today the Church celebrates Palm Sunday of the Passion of the Lord and so enters into Holy Week and the coming Sacred Paschal Triduum This week is often considered the holiest week of the Church's year hence the name as we are led through Her liturgies to a deeper understanding of salvation history and all that God has done for us I cannot encourage you enough to take part in these liturgies which are outlined on our Holy Week Insert in this weekend's bulletin On Monday April 11th Bishop Rhoades will celebrate the Chrism Mass at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Fort Wayne at 7 PM This Mass celebrates the institution of the priesthood and as it is concelebrated by the priests of the Diocese is when we yearly renew our priestly promises At this Mass Bishop Rhoades will also consecrate the Sacred Chrism the Oil of the Sick and the Oil of Catechumens These three holy oils will then be sent to every parish in the Diocese for use throughout the Church year On Holy Thursday we enter into the Sacred Paschal Triduum with the evening celebration of the Mass of the Lord's Supper Showing the unity of these three days this Mass will not conclude with a blessing but instead a procession of the Blessed Sacrament as the sanctuary is stripped bare We are invited to remain with the Lord throughout the night in our garden chapel just as he prayed at night in the Garden of Gethsemane On Good Friday the only day throughout the entire Church year when the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass is not celebrated anywhere throughout the world we join in the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord This somber service brings us to the foot of the Cross uncovered and laid bare before our eyes The service itself both begins and ends in silence expressing the depth of grief with which the Church approaches Her Crucified Lord On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord's tomb in prayer and fasting We meditate upon His Passion and Death His Decent into Hell and prayerfully await His Resurrection The darkness that looms over this time is shattered by the Paschal Candle processed into the Church at the Easter Vigil in the Holy Night This is the greatest celebration of the Church's year and walks us through salvation history itself as we join the blessed night that welcomed the Risen Christ from the tomb These ancient traditions cf Did You Know The Mass is Ancient are rich in mystery as we celebrate the anniversaries of so many wonderful events In addition to these main liturgies each day also has other offerings for your spiritual nourishment Though the Church stops at this time the world does not It is a great contrast as we are called to enter into these mysteries while also still living in a world that goes on Such is the life of the Christian called to live in the world but not of the world John 1714 15 May we strive to live differently this week not allowing our worldly concerns to keep us from experiencing the deep transformative power of Jesus Christ Parish Potluck Easter Egg Hunt For your planning purposes join us for our Parish Potluck Easter Egg Hunt on Sunday April 24th following the 10 AM Mass This date marks Divine Mercy Sunday and
