In Ordinary Time November 19 2023 You are invited to join us for Mass at 9:00am on Thursday Nov 23rd as we begin Thanksgiving Day by offering the very Sacrifice of Thanksgiving itself in the Most Holy Eucharist This weekend Nov 18th 19th the Church celebrates the Thirty third Sunday in Ordinary Time As our liturgical year is quickly coming to a close so is our walkthrough of St Matthew's Gospel from our lectionary cycle The Parable of the Talents heard today is the last parable that our Lord shares in St Matthew's Gospel before entering into His Passion It serves as one final urging His disciples ourselves included to be ready for His return Our liturgical year will conclude next weekend with the celebration of the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe This celebration gives special recognition to the dominion that Jesus is to have over all aspects of our lives And quite fittingly it will lead us into our Forty Hours Devotion As we recognize Jesus as King and Lord we like the three kings of past must come to adore Him Matthew 21 6 Last Advent we took up a theme for the liturgical year Lord Teach Us To Pray And as this year comes to a close we follow in the example of the Apostles who first made this request to the Lord During our Forty Hours Devotion we like them can now find ourselves at the feet of the Master Himself If adoration seems foreign or strange to you if you are unsure how to spend this time before the Lord kneel before him and simply make these words your own Lord teach me to pray After our devotion and as we move into a new liturgical year with the start of Advent our theme for this coming year will be Living Life Liturgically Just as we asked the Lord to teach us to pray now we place prayer at the center of our lives The liturgical year is not meant simply a guide to the daily readings at Mass but is to be a guide to our lives as we daily walk with Jesus through His life and walking with Him allow His life to change our lives Local Charitable and Spiritual Opportunities Last weekend we put out the Karing for Kids Blessing Tree Over half the angel tags have already been taken This annual charity supports local families in need ensuring that no children go without this Christmas season If you haven't done so already take an angel tag which describes a needed gift for a local child in our community Gifts need to be returned unwrapped and with their angel tag attached to the Parish Office by Monday Dec 4th Next weekend our Knights of Columbus will be hosting a Pancake and Sausage Breakfast after the Sunday morning Masses Nov 26th free will offering will be taken up at the breakfast to support the local charitable program Feeding Tomorrow's Future Today This program is a Wells County 4 initiative helping to ensure that local students in need will have food available to them each weekend As the number in need has risen all donations will greatly help to support this good cause Our charitable support must not only be material but also spiritual This is of course emphasized by the corporal and spiritual works of mercy as taught by the Church And we as a parish will have the opportunity to pray for our entire community throughout our upcoming Forty Hours Devotion from Monday Nov 27th to Wednesday Nov 29th At last look we have only four hours still in need of dedicated adorers As a reminder all are welcome to come and pray at any hour regardless if you signed up or not Finally throughout the upcoming Advent season we will be hosting a gift drive to help support The Closet a local program offered through Family Centered Services The Closet provides free clothing and necessities for infants and children from our local community We will have a full list of requested donations from The Closet posted next weekend and will start collecting donations on the first weekend of Advent through Christmas Day Faithfully in Christ Fr David PARISH CALENDAR Sat Nov 18 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sun Nov 19
