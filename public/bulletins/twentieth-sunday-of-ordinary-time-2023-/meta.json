  "text": "Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time August 20 2023 This weekend August 19th 20th the Church celebrates the Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time Continuing the fourth great narrative from St Matthew's Gospel we hear of Jesus meeting the Canaanite woman Matthew 1521 28 As reflected in the Book of Deuteronomy Deut 2016 18 Israelites viewed the Canaanites as hostile pagans and would not intermingle with them This helps to emphasize the humility and faith this woman has to even approach the Lord The first time she cried out Jesus did not even acknowledge her The second time He refused His disciples request on her behalf And the third time Jesus reminds her that He has come only for Israel and that she has no covenantal claim for that which she asks Dog was a common insult used by Israelites against Gentiles and others The fourth time however Jesus responds with compassion and answers her plea healing this Canaanite woman's daughter Turning to the early Church Fathers to understand this passage we see that St John Chrysostom the 4th Century Archbishop of Constantinople highlights the Canaanite woman's perseverance and humility He says that Jesus put the woman off three times so that at the fourth time He might crown her as He loudly proclaims woman great is your faith As St Peter would later write our faith increases through trials 1 Peter 16 7 Taken in the context of the entire fourth narrative of St Matthew's Gospel and echoed in our second reading from St Paul Romans 1113 15 29 32 we see the truth of Jesus message as revealed in and through His Church Salvation has come for all Jew and Gentile alike Jesus responded to the Canaanite woman through her perseverance humility and faith In the same way He will respond to all those who approach Him in the same way Jew and Gentile alike Catholicism Explained Series Starting on Thursday September 7th at 6:30PM in the Parish Social Hall we will be beginning our Catholicism Explained Series If you are
