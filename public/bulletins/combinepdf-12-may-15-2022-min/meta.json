  "text": "Fifth Sunday of Easter May 15 2022 special Thank You to Fr Bill Sullivan for serving as the celebrant at our Masses this weekend while I am away for a few days to visit with family special Welcome Back to all of our university students returning home for the summer May you have a blessed and restful summer This weekend the Church celebrates the Fifth Sunday of Easter Unlike many of our previous weekends this weekend is not given any additional names Instead it highlights that we are just beyond the midpoint of our Easter celebrations As our Lord exclaims in today's Gospel My children I will be with you only a little while longer John 1333 Our Easter joy will in two weeks time bring us to Ascension Thursday forty days after Easter when our Lord ascends to the right hand of the Father and then Pentecost Sunday fifty days after Easter as He sends His Holy Spirit upon the Church As we continue to celebrate Jesus conquering of death we are reminded that this celebration leads us to an even greater purpose Eternal Life with Him in Heaven Our Lord has defeated death but this is not the end of the story With death defeated we are now called to join Him in eternal life Our Easter celebrations point us to this joy Our Lord does not leave us abandoned but continues to minister through His Church For this reason we continue to hear from the Acts of the Apostles throughout the Easter season In the Acts of the Apostles St Luke continues from where his Gospel has left off Having proclaimed Jesus life in his Gospel this second work assures us that the story of Jesus has not ended but rather has taken on a new form in the life of the Church And this life continues The Church continues to make Christ present to the world We as members of the Church are called to be witnesses to this truth by imitating Christ in our lives every day Next Saturday May 21st our diocese will ordain five young men to the transitional diaconate at the Co Cathedral of St Matthew in South Bend These men along with their two classmates studying in Rome will spend the summer serving in parishes before returning to the seminary for their last year of study Next year all seven will be ordained as priests of our diocese In three weeks we will also ordain three men this year for the priesthood within our diocese They will begin serving at parishes as associate pastors at the end of June Unlike many other dioceses our diocese has truly been blessed with a large number of priestly vocations over the past many years This was seen in recent years with our now yearly Pentecost Collection helping to provide for the education of our seminarians May we continue to pray for priestly and religious vocations especially from within our own parish family Priestly and religious vocations are first born within family life and must then be supported and nurtured within our parish life Holy marriages themselves serve to foster priestly and religious vocations In addition to our weekly vocation prayer how might we help to foster priestly and religious vocations from within our own parish How can we be open to and support those considering these vocations Summer Reading Program Beginning in June we invite all of our parish youth to participate in our new Summer Reading Program The first weekend of June our youth will have the chance to register for this two month program book cart with books of various age levels up through high school will be available in the narthex next to the St Francis statue Children will have the opportunity to check out books each weekend and can earn prizes throughout the summer June July for the number of books that they read More info to come Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday May 14 8:00am Special
