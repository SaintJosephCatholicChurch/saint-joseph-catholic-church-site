  "text": "WENTY INTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME October 18 2020 This weekend Oct 17th 18th marks the 29th Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings continue to prepare us for coming of the fifth and final discourse of St Matthews Gospel on the End Times We can however see a slight shift in thematic We do not need to fear the end as Jesus is the end We belong to Him As Christians this becomes the source of our hope and joy That if we live and die with the Lord we too shall rise with Him In the end we have nothing to fear because Christ Himself is with us ARISH PDATES AND PCOMING VENTS This past week weve had several unexpected repairs popup around the parish As we begin to shift our campus from Summer to Winter mode that is not uncommon What a joy it is to know that when these unexpected expenses arise we are prepared to face them thanks to your continued generosity to the monthly Repair Rainy Day Fund Thank you for your financial stewardship and support of our parish to help ensure that we have the facilities to serve all those who come through our doors for the years to come Speaking on generous financial stewardship our stewardship in the Annual Bishops Appeal allows us to reach beyond our own parish and offers assistance to an innumerable number of people throughout northernIndiana As you know we are striving to have as close to 100 participation for this years Appeal as possible As of this week weve already received pledge cards from 40 of our parish families Were well on our way to 100 participation If you havent yet had the opportunity to return your pledge please try and do so at your earliest convenience We will be sending out a second round of mailings to those who have not yet had a chance to respond Even if you may not be in a position to financially support the appeal this year please still return your pledge card so that we know that it was received Returning the pledge card will also help save the parish on postage in the longrun Thank you for your support both spiritually and financially for the 34th Annual Bishops Appeal Its amazing to think that as the end of the liturgical year nears the beginning of Advent is only several weeks away Planning for Advent and Christmas will be a bit different this year but we will still be striving to do everything that we can to prepare together as a parish family to celebrate the Incarnation of Jesus Christ Leading up to Advent on Tuesday November 17th at 6:30PM members of our liturgical decorating committee will host a Make Your Own Advent Wreath event See this bulletin for more information and the signup sheet in the narthex For those unable to yet join us in person for events mailhome kits with instructions will be available Mark your calendars for our Advent Parish Mission We will welcome our own Fr Stephen Felicichia now parochial vicar of St Elizabeth Ann Seton in Fort Wayne to lead us in our Advent preparations each evening at 7:00PM from Monday Dec 7th through Wednesday Dec
