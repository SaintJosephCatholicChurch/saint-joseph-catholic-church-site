  "text": "First Sunday of Lent March 6 2022 special Thank You to our GIRL's Night Out for their great work with the Mardi Gra Fundraiser last Saturday It was a wonderful evening being our first large parish social gathering in many months and helping to raise funds for our parish playground This weekend March 5th 6th the Church enters into the First Sunday of Lent Though the ashes received on Ash Wednesday have worn away this holy season still remains If we are willing to approach this season with trust and humility the lessons learned from it will remain well beyond forty days Though Lent may seem such a daunting season as we are being reminded of our own mortality do not let it overwhelm you This time of penance and discipline is meant to strengthen us Even if we may falter throughout these forty days we take consolation in the Stations of the Cross On His way to Jerusalem to redeem the world our Saviour fell three times After each time however He picked Himself and continued along the way Did You Know The Church as Teacher Magisterium In an earlier column Did You Know The Bible is a Catholic Book we looked at how the Church guided by the Holy Spirit compiled the Sacred Scriptures as we know them today We described the Church as the authentic interpreter and guardian of the Sacred Scriptures which speaks to the role of the Church as the Magisterium Latin magister or teacher of the Faith This is a role that did not end when the canon of the Sacred Scriptures was set in the 4th Century but one that has continued even into our own modern day In Her role as teacher the Church teaches from the Deposit of Faith which consists of both Sacred Tradition Latin tradere or that which is handed down and Sacred Scripture Sacred Tradition from which the Sacred Scriptures themselves arose also includes such things as the Apostles Creed and our liturgical worship cf Did You Know The Mass is Ancient The two are not to be seen as opposed to one another but as working harmoniously together Taken together Sacred Tradition is to be understood in light of the Sacred Scriptures and the Sacred Scriptures are to be read within the Tradition of the Church In this way we fulfill the call of St Paul to stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught either by an oral statement or by a letter of ours 2 Thessalonians 215 And if debate or confusion arises on a particular matter we turn to the Church for guidance just as it was done at the Council of Jerusalem in AD 50 cf Acts 151 35 When speaking as the Magisterium the Church does not speak on Her own Instead as the Body of Christ here on earth the Church guided by the Holy Spirit speaks as the representative of Jesus Christ In the same manner when He sends out His disciples our Lord states Whoever listens to you listens to me Luke 1016 The Church continues in Her role as teacher commissioned by our Lord to proclaim His Holy Name to the world until He Himself returns The Magisterium in its most formal sense is found in the Pope and the Bishops in union with him The Faithful in turn are united to their bishop and through him to the Pope Following in the Office of St Peter cf Did You Know Peter was the First Pope the Pope stands as the physical and visible sign of unity among the Body of Christ here on earth This unity is reemphasized in his teaching office which serves through the promise of our Lord Himself and the guidance of the Holy Spirit John 1416 17 to guard and proclaim our One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Faith Faithfully in Christ Fr David Reminder Daylight Saving Time
