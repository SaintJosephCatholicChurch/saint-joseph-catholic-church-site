2017 YR SOLEMNITY OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST THE KING From the Pastors Desk WE ARE INVITED TO RECOGNIZE AND ACCEPT THE LORD JESUS AS THE KING OF KINGS LORD OF LORDS OUR REDEEMER AND OUR SAVIOR My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all Today is the last Sunday in the Churchs Liturgical Year The first reading and the Gospel used the im agery of sheep and shepherd to show us Gods care and love to those who obey him There is a German saying He who wants to understand the poet must go to the poets country We need to mentally go to the land of Jesus the country of the Bible where shepherd and sheep were part of the peoples daily life Here in US we can use the pets The difference is that each of us do not have pets in hundreds as Jewish families have sheep The episode signifies the last day in our lives the Day of Judgment the Parousia the second coming of the Lord Jesus We need to work hard in doing Gods will to qualify to enter into his kingdom through his mercy and love Thus in the 1st Reading Ez 341112 1517 God through the prophet Ezekiel as sured us of his Fatherly protection He said I myself will look after and tend my sheep I will rescue them from every place where they were scattered I myself will pas ture my sheep The lost I will seek out the stray I will bring back the injured I will bind up the sick I will heal This is the promise the Lord has made to us He is al ways true to his promise However He will judge us rightly with right and just judg ment So we must strive to be just in all we do in order to be saved As I told men last Sunday that they need to behave in a way that will help their wives to love them We need to strive to and allow God to be merciful to us In the Gospel Mt 253146 The Lord Jesus made it clearly to us that He would come in his glory When He comes he would separate the good people from the bad He would sit on his throne of judgment and would judge the entire world But before this general and last judgment the Parousia the second coming of the Lord Jesus in his glory there would be a private visit and judgment for each one of us This private visit and judgment takes place at death of each us Thus before the general judgment the body will rise and join to the soul and the judgment will then take place The good peo ple will be rewarded with the glory of Gods kingdom and the bad people will be pun ished with the pains of hell Right now heaven and hell are open to us We choose where to go It is always a free choice of the individual Your choice will be colored by the kind of life you live now you are on earth So now is the time for the choice where you want to be in heaven or in hell I am sure that each of us will like to go to heaven So strive now to win heaven for yourself We are called to remember our brothers and sisters who are suffering all over the world and especially in the Middle East Havoc has been done to them They lost everything they have Many have died Let us sincerely pray for them and contrib ute to help them Jesus told his disciples this would happen Remember the word I spoke to you No slave is greater than his master If they persecuted me they will also persecute you If they kept my word they will also keep yours Jn 1520 In the same vein St Augustine said the Church progresses on her pilgrim age amidst this worlds persecutions and Gods consolations CCC 769 All of us however must be prepared to confess Christ before men and to follow him along the way of the Cross amidst the persecutions which the Church never lacks CCC 1816 LG We pray that Christ the King will be present in a special way to our persecuted brothers and sisters As the Good Shepherd rescuing those scattered by war and persecution He binds up those injured by persecution torture and abuse He pro vides spiritual strength for them in the sight of their foes Let us express our love for them The Gospel calls us to be peacemakers We are bound to promote peace in a world surrounded by violence and conflict Todays solemnity reminds us that when we pray Thy kingdom come we are praying for a kingdom of truth life holiness grace justice love peace Preface a kingdom for which many of our sisters and brothers are suffering persecution The Prayer over the Gifts is also a prayer for those suffering persecution that your Son himself may bestow on all nations the gifts of unity love justice and peace Continued to next page The amount needed each week to make budget is 511640 We are 92265 behind budget from last week Other Collections within our Parish St Vincent de Paul 7100 30th ABA Over
