  "text": "Mu's i c ma y b emo r el i v e l y OURTH UNDAY OF ENT ARCH 14 2021 Entering into the Fourth Sunday of Lent March 13th 14th or Laetare Sunday we are at the midpoint of the Lenten season For this reason our penitential journey is today mixed with tinges of joy and consolation to remind us what we are journeying towards The Joy of the Resurrection But just like the joy found atop the mount of the Transfiguration Mark 9210 this joy gives us only a moment of respite as we continue towards Jerusalem and the Crucifixion The rose vestments and flowers adorning the altar this weekend will be replaced with the rich violet veils covering all of our statues and crucifixes next weekend as we continue on from Laetare Sunday and enter into Passiontide In recognizing the joy that is to come we are given the strength to approach even the Cross itself with our blessed Lord For it is only through this journey of Lent in walking the way of Cross that we understand the true gift that is our salvation in Jesus Christ Though our Lenten journey continues we have a brief respite this Friday March 19th in celebrating the Solemnity of St Joseph This solemnity of the universal patron of the Church our parish patron is to be observed as a day of celebration Though this day falls on a Friday during Lent we are dispensed on this day March 19th from abstaining from meat and our normal Lenten observances This moment of celebration helps remind us that our Lenten fast is kept each year to prepare us for an eternal feast Fasting itself remains an important part of the spiritual life We are called to fast not only during Lent but every Friday of the year In this way every Friday serves as a miniLent and through our selfdenial unites us in prayerful remembrance of the passion of Jesus Christ Though this practice is traditionally observed by abstaining from meat on Fridays the United States Bishops on Nov 27 1966 has allowed for the substitution of other penitential practices for our personal Friday fasts outside of Lent either through a voluntary act of selfdenial or performing an act of charity For our celebration of the Solemnity of St Joseph we will have an altered liturgical schedule this Friday Masses on Friday March 19th will be offered at both 8:30AM and 7:00PM To accommodate this special Friday evening Mass Confessions will be heard from 500545 PM and Stations of the Cross will be at 6:00PM At the end of Mass we will also have medals and holy cards of St Joseph available in the narthex thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor PDATES REGARDING ONGREGATIONAL INGING As mentioned at the end of January our diocesan directives have been updated to allow for the return of soft congregational singing which is the congregation singing at a moderate sound level while masked Many of our parishes have already begun implementing this practice As expected those parishes that have resumed congregational singing have not experienced any adverse effects from the return of hymnody in the liturgy Given this allowance and the safe implementation observed at our other parishes we will resume soft congregational singing beginning at the Easter Vigil April 4th This allows us to enter into the Easter season and the joy of the Resurrection as we once again lift our voices together in song to the praise and glory of God As directed by Bishop Rhoades this return to congregational singing will require our continued vigilance regarding physical distancing and the wearing of face masks within the Church Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS
