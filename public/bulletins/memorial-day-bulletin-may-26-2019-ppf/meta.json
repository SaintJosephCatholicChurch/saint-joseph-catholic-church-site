EASTER MAY 26 2019 As we as a nation commemorate Memorial Day this weekend may we remember and pray for the courageous men and women who have laid down their lives in service to our nation for the sake of freedom and peace Eternal rest grant unto them Lord and let perpetual light shine upon them May they rest in peace May we also pray for the families of these men and women that our Lord will fill their homes and their lives with His strength and love All are welcome to join us as we begin Memorial Day Monday May 27th with morning Mass at 9:00am Fr Silvino who will be with us throughout June informed me this week that he will be participating in the annual diocesan Priest Retreat that occurs dur ing the first week of June In addition the various priests who are often able to substitute at the parish for daily Masses on days when I am away will also be away at the retreat Due to these unforeseen circumstances Im afraid that we will have to make a few changes to our daily Mass schedule for the first week of June weekend Masses will not be affected Daily Mass from Tuesday June 4th through Friday June 7th will be can celled Additionally our weekday times of exposition and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and confession will also be cancelled that first week of June again our weekend schedule will not change This also means that our new addition of adoration and confession every Wednesday evening as announced in last weeks bulletin will not become a part of our weekly parish schedule until Wednesday June 8th The Church will of course remain open for private prayer throughout the week I apologize for this inconvenience At the beginning of May you may recall that we offered an additional evening Mass on the first Friday of the month a day dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus This evening Mass celebrated in addition to our normal daily Mass was offered as a Low Mass according to the 1962 Missal also known as the Extraor dinary Form of the Mass meaning the prayers except for the Readings and Homily were prayed in Latin We had a wonderful attendance for this evening Mass and a very engaging discussion following the Mass regarding both the 1962 Missal the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council and devotion to the Sacred Heart Since that time Ive been asked multiple times if this additional Mass would become a monthly practice or if it was a onetime occurrence Due to the hecticness of the summer schedule and my extended absence we will not be able to offer this additional Mass time on First Friday in either June or July We will however resume this devotional practice when I return in August For your plan ning purposes we will resume offering our additional evening Mass for First Fri days on Friday August 2nd This Mass will continue to be offered as a Low Mass according to the Extraordinary Form and will be scheduled in addition to our nor mal daily Mass As we enter into this Sixth Week of Easter our readings are preparing us for the Ascension of our Lord celebrated this coming weekend Though our Lord has ascended to the right hand of the Father His ministry continues to this day through His Church under the guidance and protection of the Holy Spirit We as members of the mystical Body of Christ through our baptism continue His minis try everyday of our lives as we strive for holiness The challenges and struggles we face will vary according to our vocations and state in life Yet as many parts of one body we are all still called to that fullness of the Christian life This com ing Saturday June 1st we will have the opportunity to pray for our brothers in Christ whose vocations have led them to the ministerial priesthood Dcn Jose Ar royo Dcn Dan Niezer and Dcn Spenser St Louis will be ordained to the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ by Bishop Rhoades himself a successor to the Apos tles and begin their lives of dedicated service to their Bride the Church The Mass of Ordination will be this Saturday June 1st at the Cathedral in Fort Wayne at 11:00am The Mass is open to all and if youve never had the chance to experi ence an ordination before I would strongly encourage you to attend Following the Mass of Ordination in Fort Wayne I will begin my travels to Washington DC for my summer classes at Catholic University One of the first things I will do upon arriving in Washington DC is head to the National Basilica of the Immaculate Conception and pray for our parish and for each of you Please keep me in your prayers in these coming months I look forward to seeing you when I return in August
