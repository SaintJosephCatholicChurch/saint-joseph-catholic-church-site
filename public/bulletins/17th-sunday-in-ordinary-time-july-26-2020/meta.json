  "text": "EVENTEENTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME July 26 2020 This weekend July 25th26th marks the Seventeenth Sunday in Ordi nary Time which is the halfway point in this liturgical season We will remain in this season interrupted only by the occasional feast day or solemnity for another 17 weeks before the liturgical year concludes with the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe in November With the end of one litur gical year a new year of grace begins as we once again have the wonderful opportunity to walk with our blessed Lord through His life as revealed within Sacred Scripture Looking ahead however does not mean that we ignore what is still to come We have a wonderful opportunity within these next 17 weeks as we continue to walk with our blessed Lord through the Gospel of St Matthew As mentioned before St Matthews Gospel is broken into five different dis courses And today we will conclude the third of these five great discourses in our Gospel reading Matthew 134452 Throughout this discourse we have heard of the great power and awe of God through many different parables Responding to the opposition against Him by the Pharisees Matthew 1121250 Jesus speaks in parables to a generation who has hardened their hearts against Him Matthew 111619 By speaking in parables our blessed Lord challenges His disciples ourselves included to approach Him in thought reflection and humility We must ask ourselves When we seek out our blessed Lord why are we seeking Him What are we looking for If we seek out Jesus Christ we will find Him But this cannot be a half hearted effort For as we hear in the first two parables today when a treasure or a pearl of great price is found the one who has found it will sell everything out of joy to obtain it When we encounter the risen Lord we encounter love Himself for God is love 1 John 48 And we have the opportunity to encoun ter Him each and every day In Sacred Scripture in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the Sacraments and in service to one another These encounters cannot leave us unchanged Dressing the Chalice Some may have noticed an additional liturgical item present on the cre dence table during Mass The chalice veil and burse covering the chalice While we have been using a chalice veil during weekday liturgies for several months it has only been introduced for our weekend liturgies in the past few weekends As seen on the diagram on the right it is the cloth covering placed over the chalice when dressing or preparing the chalice for Mass Encouraged to be used by the General Instruction of the Roman Missal para 118 the chalice veil like all liturgical items holds both practical pur pose and symbolic meaning Practically the chalice veil serves to protect the chalice and helps to distinguish between the Liturgy of the Word and the Lit urgy of the Eucharist The burse similarly matches the chalice veil and holds the corporal in place atop the chalice Spiritually veils within church serves to signify that which is sacred The chalice has been consecrated which sets it apart for liturgical use and it will now hold the Most Precious Blood of Jesus Christ When the chalice veil is removed the splendor of the chalice is shown and we are visually reminded that the sacred mysteries are about to be revealed After the purification of the chalice the chalice veil is put back on Having just received our blessed Lord in the Holy Eucharist we are now visually reminded that the truths of our Faith are often hidden from view Just as we know the chalice is under the veil so must it be evident in our lives that our blessed Lord is in our hearts PS This Thursday July 30th is the Feast of Bl Solanus Casey Bl Solanus was a Capuchin Franciscan who lived at St Felix Friary in nearby Huntington for ten years With this connection to Bl Solanus we are one of two dioceses in the world who will celebrate his feast day Mass on Thursday will be at 5:30PM and I invite you to join
