  "text": "HIRD UNDAY ASTER PRIL 18 2021 Our Easter season or Eastertide continues as the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Easter this weekend April 17th 18th Just as we spent forty days of Lent preparing for the joy of Easter we now spend fifty days meditating upon the mystery of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ Yet whether we knew it or not our preparations for this time of celebration began well before even Lent itself Living within our liturgical year our preparation for this Easter season truly began at the start of the Church year with Advent The holy longings of Advent brought us to the sweet joys of Christmas From the joys of Christmas we were prepared to hear the severe truths of Ordinary Time learning the cost of discipleship And learning from these truths we entered as disciples into the contrition and penance of Lent which brought us to the heartrending sight of the Passion in the Sacred Paschal Triduum This path from beginning to end leads us anew each year all the way to the sublime glory of the Paschal celebration found in the Resurrection of Jesus Christ This holy season is meant to fill our souls with joy as we join together in celebrating the risen Christ This joy of the soul serves as a true foretaste of eternal happiness and we should strive to keep it within our hearts always We find this joy by walking with Jesus who brings us new life and shunning sin which causes death ARISH AMPUS PDATES Spring is in the air As the spring weather continues to warm up we often want to spend much more time outside in the sunshine To help facilitate outdoor activities we have several different parish projects ongoing Yesterday a number of parishioners helped to fashion garden boxes behind the Church Several of these raised garden beds will be used to grow fresh flowers for the Church and the remainder are open for use Please contact the Parish Office if you would like to claim some garden space and test out your greenthumb Last Fall 2020 I tasked our Knights of Columbus with putting forward recommendations for a new parish playground While our parishs current playground has served well for the past 20 years it is in need of an update Our Knights put together a subcommittee to review the best options for the playground and will be making their suggestions to me soon Once received we will plan on moving forward with their suggestions If everything goes according to plan we will have a new playground and picnic tables for seating installed for use throughout the Summer Our parishs Rosary Path continues to offer a beautiful space to spend time in nature and meditate upon the life of our Lord Jesus Christ To help ensure its yearly upkeep we are forming the Rosary Path Committee This group will help to ensure that the path is upkept weeded and maintained throughout the year If you like yard work and want to help maintain the Rosary Path there will be an informational meeting on Saturday May 1st at 10 AM in the Parish Conference Room In the Cry Room there is a Marianthemed Stained Glass window When the addition of the Parish Center was added in 2000 the windows exterior looking towards the Parish Offices was covered with drywall Thanks to the assistance of Eric Mechling and Joe Bauer the window is now opened on both sides and framed in the wall special Thank You for their help Faithfully in Christ Fr
