THEME THEY WERE ASTOUNDED AT HIS TEACHING FOR HE TAUGHT THEM AS ONE HAVING AUTHORITY AND NOT AS THE SCRIBES Mark 122 BY Fr Robert deLeon CSC Some years back I met Kim a sparkling young woman who in the course of conversa tion shared with me her pain at her grandmothers mortal illness Kim and her grand mother were especially close and now with death so near that bond was tightening Kim was already grieving the anticipated loss her frequent reports of visits confirming the approaching demise Then the phone call came early one morning Grandmother had died Though Id never met her I felt that Id known her for years through her granddaughters stories On a snowy blustery January morning we gathered at the church where the funeral would take place Meeting new faces with a handshake I found myself repeating a mantra I know Grandmother through Kim As the Mass began a few of my own tears joined Kims when the music mingled with memories Together we all sang Precious Lord take my hand lead me on let me stand I am tired I am weak I am worn through the storm through the night lead me on to the light take my hand pre cious Lord lead me home Yes this was Grandmothers faith speaking to us And it was from this faith that Kim could laugh even amidst the tears as delivering the eulogy she related stories of Grandmothers life We gathered together a whole churchfull in tribute to a long life of God centered love When Grandmothers funeral procession arrived at the cemetery with the day growing colder and windier we climbed the hill to her waiting grave beside that of her prede ceased husband Huddling around the casket as if seeking a campfires warmth we rushed through the prescribed prayers as ears noses and fingertips numbed With our concluding Amen a cloud of frosted breath Grandmothers final request was deliv ered by Kim With all the solemnity she could muster as both tears and laughter strug gled for the upper hand Kim addressed us Would everyone now take one of Grand mothers flowers and follow me Thirty of us each plucked a flower from the arrange ments surrounding Grandmothers casket and followed Kim through the snow as she approached a grave two rows away and placed her flower before a small headstone now almost hidden beneath a snowdrift When all of us had done likewise in mysteri ous tribute to whomever was buried here Kims explanation was accented with gig gles Now that shes dead I can tell you that Grandmother was a thief After Grandfa ther died shed come to the cemetery a few times each week and took flowers from this grave to put on Grandfathers Whoever is buried here always had fresh flowers so Grandmother borrowed them She made me promise that wed square things up when she died Loud laughter our last frosted salute to Grandmother we ran to the warmth of our waiting cars Life is the best teacher and the lessons most ingrained in us are those learned from the example of others In todays Gospel passage we hear that the disciples Were as tounded at Jesus teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes Mark 122 What so astounded the disciples was that Jesus actually lived what he taught His words were not empty as were those of other religious leaders of the day Grandmothers long life of deep faith was almost taken for granted but when we en tered the church for the last time in her company it was she who sang to us of her hearts deepest desire Precious Lord take my hand lead me on let me stand I am tired I am weak I am worn through the storm through the night lead me on to the light take my hand precious Lord lead me home Grandmother was homesoul in heaven body on a hilltop borrowed flowers returned and a lifelong lesson in faith passed on to a new generation WELCOME Jan 2728 Fr Gus Gordon
