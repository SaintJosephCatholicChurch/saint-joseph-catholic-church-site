3RD 2018 YR 9TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YR WE ALL ARE INVITED TO COME AND EAT THE BODY AND DRINK THE BLOOD OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all As we celebrate the Solemnity of the Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ we recall what Jesus told us Unless you eat the Body of the Son of Man and drink His Blood there is no life in you So the Lord said THIS IS MY BODY THIS IS MY BLOOD Therefore his Body is real food and his Blood is real drink The Holy Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ it is real food and real drink The Blessed Sacrament is t he presence of the Lord among us In ordinary circumstances of life food and drink are the most essential need of the human person What food is to the body is what the Holy Eucharist is to the human soul The importance of the Holy Eucharist cannot be over emphasized It is the center of our Christian life the apex In the celebration of the Holy Mass the Lord Jesus is very kind and to make sure that we are fed he established two tables the table of the Word and the table of the Eucharist That is why in the 1st Reading Ex 2438 After Moses had addressed the people they said We will do everything that the Lord has told us Jesus con firmed the importance of the Word when he said My food is to do the will of my Father So to obey the instructions of God which is the Word of God is food Then the table of the Eucharist is the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ And so in the Gospel he said Take it this is my body He took the cup and said This is my blood of the covenant which will be poured out for many And to express the importance of His Eucharistic Body and Blood he said Unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you will not have life in you He who eats and drinks will live forever For Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood will be in me and I in him So we must eat it in order to be saved But we must be worthy before we can eat and drink For St Paul warned us and said that if anyone eats or drinks it unwor thily the person is guilty of sacrilege We should desire to eat and drink the body and blood of Christ for our salvation But unfortunately some of us desire and hunger for things of less value such as power authority prestige honor money respect etc more than they desire the Body and Blood of Christ Another aspect of the Holy Eucharist is Gods presence among us his people The pres ence of the Lord among us is real He promised to be with us till the end of time When Saul was travelling to Damascus to persecute the Christians and the Lord Jesus en countered him on the road to Damascus and said Saul Saul why are you persecuting me He did not say Why are you persecuting my followers So we are truly mem bers of the body of Christ Jesus And today we shall express our belief in the presence of the Lord Jesus in the Eucha rist among us during the Eucharistic procession after 7:30am Mass We are saved through the Eucharist We are not only washed clean in the blood of the Lamb but we enter into communion with God through the eating of the body and drinking of the blood of the Lamb We need to praise and thank God for this precious gift we received through our ancestors in the faith and pray that this Holy Eucharist will nourish us and help us to succeed in the mission the Lord Jesus gave us The mission to teach all na tions NB Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu SCHEDULE MASS INTENTIONS The most beautiful gift one can give to another
