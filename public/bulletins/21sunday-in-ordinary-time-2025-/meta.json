Sunday in Ordinary Time August 24 2025 This weekend August 23rd 24th the Church celebrates the Twenty first Sunday in Ordinary Time Having passed the midpoint of the liturgical year we continue to walk with our Lord along the path of His final journey as recorded in St Luke's account of the travel narrative Luke 10 19 This journey of teaching and preaching brings our Lord ever nearer to Jerusalem from where He will give His greatest sermon upon the Cross on Calvary Hill Though our readings do have a somber tone the knowledge they share is profound and deeply relevant for our lives even today In our Gospel reading a bystander asks our Lord Will only a few be saved Jesus does not respond with a number but instead a command Strive to enter through the narrow gate His point is clear Salvation is God's free gift in Christ but it is not something we can presume upon This gift once given must be received with gratitude and faithfully lived out in our daily lives Our First Reading reveals God's plan to gather all nations together to Himself foreshadowing the universal mission of the Church The Second Reading reminds us that the trials we endure are not signs of abandonment but of God's fatherly love for us shaping us in holiness Seen in this light the Gospel becomes both a sobering warning and a hopeful invitation We are called to repent persevere and follow Christ with undivided hearts The narrow gate may be difficult to enter but it is the way that leads to eternal life Ministry Fair special Thank You to all of our parish ministry's who are represented at our Ministry Fair this weekend The majority of these ministries represent our various ministries of service and community We also have a number of other ministries in the parish that focus on the
