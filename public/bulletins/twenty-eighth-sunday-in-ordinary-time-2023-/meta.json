  "text": "Twenty Eighth Sunday in Ordinary Time October 15 2023 This weekend October 14th15th the Church celebrates the Twenty eighth Sunday in Ordinary Time The month of October is many things in the life of the Church Nationally our Bishops Conference annually marks October as Respect Life Month In this month we are called by our bishops to consider more deeply why every human life is valuable and reflect on how to build a culture that protects life from conception to natural death Universally the Church has traditionally marked October as the Month of the Most Holy Rosary This observance itself initially dates back to the 1500s and the establishment of the Feast of the Most Holy Rosary which we celebrated on October 7th It was solidified by Pope Leo XIII at the end of the 19th Century as he strongly promoted a worldwide increased devotion to the Blessed Mother by encouraging the constant use of the Rosary in prayer These two focuses for October Respect of Life and the Holy Rosary though seemingly different are intimately connected In the words of Pope Pius XII the Rosary serves as a compendium of the entire Gospel And in the Gospel we receive the Word of Life In the Rosary we contemplate the life of Christ through the eyes of His mother And through this contemplation we are called to recognize Christ in the life of one another In these difficult times especially as we see the great disregard for human life so present in the world may we make prayer especially the Holy Rosary our weapon For it is only such a weapon that can truly conquer evil and bring about that peace found only in the King of Peace Himself Jesus Christ In this prayer following in the example of the Blessed Mother herself we are led to hold the Word of God in our hearts cf Luke 219 which cannot leave us unchanged Blessing and Re dedication of the Church Bell Immediately following our 10 AM Mass next Sunday October 22nd we will bless and re dedicate the old church bell from Cherry Street This bell donated to our parish in 1902 has been beautifully restored by the Verdin Company And following our parish vote the bell will be dedicated and named in honor of St Gabriel the Archangel As St Gabriel first heralded the good news of Jesus Christ so shall this bell do the same every time that it rings As famously described in the 19th Century poetic classic Song of the Bell a church bell serves to call the living and mourn the dead The use of church bells dates back to as early as the 5th Century and have a very interesting history that we will hear of next weekend Through our church bell we are reminded of how we are united to both this universal history and our own parish history Donated to our parish by the outgoing pastor of St Aloysius in 1902 this bell reflects our parish's history of being a mission parish to St Aloysius in Sheldon now Yoder Placed in the steeple of the old church on Cherry Street it served as a reminder of God's presence in the world And now returned to our campus it can continue to fulfill this purpose as it rings loudly for years to come special Thank You to the Goodwin family who have helped to facilitate the return of the bell in memory of their late parents Carl and Melba Goodwin Church Heating System As previously mentioned our hot water heating system in the Church has two settings On and Off Several weeks ago we had our boilers serviced During this annual maintenance an order was placed for a replacement part needed before the boilers can be turned on As of writing this column we are still waiting on the replacement part to arrive Once it does arrive and the maintenance can be completed the system will be turned on for the season November Memorial Candles As the month of November quickly approaches we will begin collecting the All Souls Day Memorial Candles to be burned in the Church throughout the month If you took your loved one's Memorial Candle home please return it to either the desk in the narthex or the Parish Office Faithfully in Christ Fr David Saturday October 14 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am Confession 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Rex Ehrhart Sunday October 15
