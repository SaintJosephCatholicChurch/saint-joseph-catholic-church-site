TIME October 20 2019 special Thank You to Electric Company and parishioner Andy Va chon for their wonderful work in bringing our exterior lighting project to reality As the project nears completion our campus has already been transformed The in creased lighting in our parking lot makes the Church visible at night increasing both security and safety throughout our campus The improved lighting will be invaluable in the winter months to ensure that the parking lot is visible especially for our morn ing and evening Mass crowds and help to ensure that it can be safely crossed In the coming weeks we will be celebrating the Holy Day of All Saints Day On this day we rejoice with our brothers and sisters who having kept the faith 2 Timothy 468 are now united with Christ in the heavenly Kingdom Our Mass times for the Holy Day will be a Vigil Mass on Thursday Oct 31st at 7 PM and Masses on Friday Nov 1st at both 7 AM and 5:30PM Following the Friday Nov 1st 5:30PM Mass we will celebrate our Annual All Saints Day Party Our children are invited to dress up as their favorite Saints costumes need not be elabo rate and join in the procession at our 5:30PM Mass Please arrive by 5:20PM to join in the procession Following the Mass the Parish will provide a simple meal in the Parish So cial Hall followed by our costume contest games in the gym for our children and trivia in the hall for adults If you are planning to attend please signup on the poster board in the narthex The signup will help us to estimate how much food will be needed for the meal In the Saints we see that which we ourselves long for Union with God in the Heavenly Kingdom As we hope to one day be numbered among these Saints this Holy Day is a day worth celebrating together as a parish family As the Fall weather comes upon us we are in the process of turning on the Churchs heating system Like many larger buildings our system has two settings On and Off Once on our hot water radiators will run until they are turned off in the Spring keeping the Church at a comfortable temperature I thank you for your pa tience as the necessary service is performed to turn our heating system on We are on schedule with Dunwiddie Heating to have our system serviced this week as I write this column and the heat should be up and running either this or next weekend Thank you again for your patience As our heating system is turned on again we will also be completing our previously mentioned transition from oil to wax candles at use during the Mass Af ter much discussion with both Dunwiddie Heating and Root Candles our candle supplier oil candles have been identified as one possible source of the damage that appeared along our north interior Church wall during this past winter To eliminate this possibility from consideration we will be returning to the use of wax candles during the Mass As mentioned last weekend any overage from our Annual Bishops Appeal will be put toward repairing this damage Before doing so however we want to ensure weve isolated the issue and ensure that it will not happen again once weve repainted the wall The use of wax candles in the liturgy also holds much historical and sym bolic significance In the first days of the Church when Christianity was illegal and Masses were offered in the catacombs wax candles were used out of necessity By the 4th and 5th Century however their use was associated as a symbol of Faith recall ing the True Light which enlightens every man who comes into this world John 19 They also symbolize Christian Hope the zeal for charity Christian Joy and fer vent prayer which rises up to Heaven Finally in the burning of wax candles we are also reminded of our own mortality and our need for Jesus Christ as we see the can dles burn down and eventually extinguished As always all things at use in the lit urgy are meant to draw our hearts and lift up our minds to God Faithfully in Christ Fr David Faith makes all things possible Hope makes all things bright Love makes all things easy WEEKEND OF OCTOBER 2627 2019 CANTORS 500 Larry Leitz 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Nichole Decker LECTORS 500 Stacey Coulardot 730 Ben Wagner
