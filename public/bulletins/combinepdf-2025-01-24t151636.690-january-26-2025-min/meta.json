222 40 or 222 32 Third Sunday in Ordinary Time January 26 2025 This weekend January 25th 26th the Church celebrates the Third Sunday in Ordinary Time This Sunday is also known as Word of God Sunday as we focus in a special way on the living word of God that comes forth from the 73 Books of Sacred Scripture In the words of Pope Francis the Word of God is meant to pass from our ears to our hearts to our hands The Word of God is meant to convict us to perform good deeds in Jesus name With our entrance into Ordinary Time we now begin an uninterrupted scriptural journey in the St Luke's Gospel for the liturgical year St Luke the beloved physician Colossians 414 and companion of St Paul 2 Timothy 411 offers a unique perspective amongst the Gospel writers As heard in today's prologue he is writing to Theophilus whose name in Greek means Friend of God to provide an orderly account of the good news Though not an Apostle or direct eye witness to the Gospel St Luke came to know the Lord through the testimony of the Apostles and other eye witnesses Given the details accounted in the Infancy Narrative Luke 15 252 tradition has held that the Blessed Mother herself served as an eyewitness source to him St Luke would have also come to know the Lord through the prayer worship and life of the early Church as he himself records in Acts 242 47 The Gospel of St Luke serves to demonstrates how both Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition work together to communicate faithfully what God has revealed to us through Christ What came to be written in the Gospels comes from and is in service to what was being preached taught and lived in the life of the early Church In the memorable words of Archbishop Sheen The Church did not come out of the Gospels the Gospels came out of the Church Presentation of the Lord Blessing of Candles of Throats Next weekend the Church celebrates the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord This feast day falls every year on February 2nd marking the fortieth day since Christmas On this day in accord with the Law of Moses cf Leviticus 121 8 the Blessed Mother and Saint Joseph presented the Christ child in the Temple This is our last fleeting glimpse of Christmastide before fully setting our hearts in preparation for the coming of Lent Though we often celebrate this feast day during the week with a muted celebration this year it falls on a Sunday As such we are able to greet this joyous celebration with greater solemnity As a part of this celebration we will bless many of the candles that we use throughout the year for Mass You are invited to bring any candles from your home with you that you would like to have blessed at the start of Mass next weekend Included among the various candles we will bless are the candles used for the Blessing of Throats in honor of the Feast of St Blaise As St Blaise's feast day falls on Monday February 3rd we will offer the Blessing of Throats after all Masses next weekend This blessing a sacramental prayer which invokes the intercession of St Blaise for protection against all illnesses of the throat is open to all who wish to come forward and receive it Presentation of the Lord 150th Anniversary Prayer As part of our parish's sesquicentennial anniversary we have composed an anniversary prayer that will be presented to the parish next weekend At the suggestion of our Parish Council we will be integrating this prayer as a prayer to be said immediately before Mass each weekend throughout our anniversary year This prayer will be led by our Cantor and recited together by our parish family after the Introit Entrance Antiphon and before the Opening Hymn The anniversary prayer was composed by Nick our Engagement Director and myself before being presented to the Parish Council for suggestions and approval As we will see next weekend the prayer is one that both gives thanks to Almighty God for the past 150th years of grace that He has shown to our parish family and asks His guidance for all the years to come Faithfully in Christ Fr David Weekend of February 1st 2nd 500 Teresa Smith 730 David Smith 1000 Jay CrispAdult Choir 500 Marita Crawfis 730 Sarah McCorkle 1000 Mike
