  "text": "WENTY IGHTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME October 11 2020 On this 28th Sunday in Ordinary Time Oct 10th11th we continue in our preparation for the fifth and final great discourse of St Matthews Gospel We will continue this period of preparation for the entire month of October before finally entering fully into the fifth discourse in the last weekends of November St Matthew spends these many chapters in his Gospel focused on all those Jew and Gentile alike who have rejected Jesus These Gospel parables which are at first glance seemingly harsh actually serve as a loving call to conversion Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life John 146St Matthew is being very clear We need Jesus to be the center of our lives Or as St John Leonardi said in the 16th Century The medicine of God is Jesus Christ crucified and risen Speaking of the end of the world St Matthews Gospel puts an emphasis on the urgency of this message Having been invited into this joyous relationship by the King Himself we cannot remain complacent in our relationship with Jesus Christ The Heavenly Host Among Us All Saints Day DressUp This year the Solemnity of All Saints falls on a Sunday Nov 1st Given the great importance of this celebration it will actually be celebrated as our Sunday liturgy taking the place of the 31st Sunday in Ordinary Time This will be reflected in the prayers of the Mass our weekend readings and our liturgical vestments the Green worn in Ordinary Time will for the day become the WhiteGold of joyous celebration This will also be our opportunity to host our Third Annual All Saints Day Celebration Due to our diocesan safety precautions this celebration will look a little different than the past two years but will still be a wondrous celebration nonetheless As with past years we invite all of our youth and those young at heart as well to dress up as their favorite Saint for the 10 AM Mass on Sunday November 1st After Mass Ill invite those dressed up forward to introduce their Saint There will also be a special treat box for each child to take home with them Beginning with the End Bible Study on the Book of Revelation Starting in November I will be offering a weekly Bible Study on the Book of Revelation Nearing the end of the liturgical year our readings have themselves become more and more focused on the end times If this theme isnt yet evident it will become very clear by November as we enter the last three weekends of the liturgical year And when speaking of the end times where else should we look but the Book of Revelation also known as the Apocalypse of St John This last book of the Sacred Scriptures is one of great importance and very fascinating but can also be very confusing Oftentimes we focus entirely on worldly concerns regarding the end times but in doing so we lose sight of the heavenly beginnings of which the author is speaking From our own participation in the heavenly Liturgy that is the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass I believe that we will be able to recognize much in the Book of Revelation much more than we ourselves are aware of Has this piqued your interest If so there is a signup sheet in the Narthex for this Bible Study Due to the difficulty of scheduling times we will first have a signup sheet for those who are interested in participating And from there I will contact all those who signup and try to find the best times for the Bible Study to meet The signup sheet will be in the Narthex for these next three weekends Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday October 10 8:00am Special
