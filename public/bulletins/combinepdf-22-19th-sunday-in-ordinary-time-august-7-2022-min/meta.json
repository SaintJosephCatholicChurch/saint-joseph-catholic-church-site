  "text": "Nineteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time August 7 2022 This weekend August 6th 7th the Church celebrates the Nineteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Continuing with the theme of discipleship our readings again highlight how we are called to be vigilant and faithful servants of the Lord The life of discipleship is not simply a moment but a journey that endures throughout the entirety of our lives In the words of St John Vianney Patron of parish priests throughout the Christian life we should not do anything which cannot be offered to God How appropriate it is that we are reminded of these sentiments as our students staff and families prepare to welcome a new school year As disci ples we are called to live out our Faith in the everyday and the ordinary One of the ways that we live out our Faith is in and through our vocations in life which is both our state of life single married or religious life and our daily work teacher administrator student etc In our daily work the work of our hands we have something to offer to God No matter how great or small the action it is changed when given over to God Our work becomes salvific We can find this exemplified in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass Simple gifts of bread and wine in the hands of Christ become His very Body and Blood When we invite the Lord into our lives into our everyday into our daily work His hands transforms our work His very presence changes everything Returning to the Confessional Over two years ago we began to make use of the Cry Room in the back of the Church as a make shift Confessional This use was necessary to be in compliance with our diocesan liturgical guidelines regarding social distancing in response to COVID 19 Starting this weekend we will once again begin using our regular Confessionals From this Saturday onward I will return to hearing confessions in the Confessional on the northside or St Joseph side of the Church The northside Confessional has been slightly modified as indicated on the Confessional doors The priest will be seated in the middle and the penitent can make use of either side of the Confessional The left door has a kneeler and is screened allowing for anonymous confessions The right door has a chair and allows for face to face confessions There a signs marking each door special Thank You to parishioners Joe Bauer and Rick Singer for their work in modifying the Confessionals The Confessional on the southside or Marian side of the Church will be used for Penance Services and as needed Before our next Penance Service it will also be receiving a slight modification with the inclusion of a frosted window in the main Confessional door This will allow for visibility within the Confessional while also ensuring anonymity These modifications were encouraged diocesan wide by Bishop Rhoades to help ensure that the confessionals in each parish meet our diocesan Safe Environment regulations Did You Know Campaign Part II Starting next weekend our Did You Know Campaign will resume This campaign is a continued opportunity for outreach and education within both our own parish family and throughout our entire community Previously we looked at many common questions that are often asked about the Catholic Faith such as Are Catholics Christians and Do Catholics worship Mary Moving forward we will be looking at many of the common items that one might experience when entering a Church For example next weekend we will look at why Catholic Churches have a Crucifix hung in the Sanctuary Future topics could include Holy Water statutes stained glass windows etc Keep your eyes peeled for this upcoming campaign Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday August 6 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm
