2018 This weekend the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Nativity or birth of St John the Baptist As we celebrate this wondrous solemnity of the forerunner of the Messiah we will hear different readings for both the Saturday Vigil and the Sunday Masses Yet though the readings will be different each of them shows us a similar truth That St John the Baptist always points us to Jesus In our first reading from either Jeremiah 1410 or Isaiah 4916 we hear of how God knows and loves each of us from the very first moment of our existence Before He even formed us in the womb he knew us Jer 15 Because of this as the Psalmist says in Psalm 139 we are wonderfully made Each of us is loved by God Himself And like John each of us no matter how young or old always has a purpose in this life purpose that has been given to us by God In our second reading from either 1 Peter 1812 or Acts of the Apostles 132226 we learn the purpose of Johns life His entire lifes mission is to prepare the way for the Messiah Acts 1324 And he does this by preaching a message of repentance This message is one that is greatly received by all who hear it for a simple reason Johns life mirrors his message He doesnt simply call others to repentance but lives a life of penance himself The authenticity of his life is what attracts all people to himself He doesnt however stop there Instead he points them along the way to the Christ These readings culminate in our Gospel where we hear about the event we are cele brating Johns miraculous birth Luke 1 As John grew in Elizabeths womb for nine months so also did the word of God in the silence of Zechariahs heart And as John enters into the world Zechariah breaks his silence and proclaims the goodness of God Even in his birth John helps point us towards God And as he grows and undertakes his ministry he will utter those deepest of words clearly reflected in his life concern ing Jesus He must increase I must decrease John 330 As I begin this journey with you as your pastor I hope to take these words of John to heart The priestly ministry is one to be lived entirely for Jesus Christ Every word spoken every action done every decision made is to bring greater glory to God That we may decrease so that He may increase To humble ourselves so that we may be more open to God in our lives and to allow Him to guide us He has made He knows us completely and He loves us entirely May we allow Him to increase in our hearts so that we can know the true joy that He brings into our lives Faithfully in Christ Fr David SCHEDULE MASS INTENTIONS The most beautiful gift one can give to another person is a Spiritual Bouquet of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass No material gift can ever compare to or equal the Infinite Value of the Holy Mass Call the Parish office to schedule 8241380 Masses may be scheduled for the living as well as the deceased To be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love and to work and to play and to look up at the starsto think seldom of your enemies often of your friends and every day of Christ and to spend as much time as you can with body and with spirit in Gods outofdoorsthese are little guideposts on
