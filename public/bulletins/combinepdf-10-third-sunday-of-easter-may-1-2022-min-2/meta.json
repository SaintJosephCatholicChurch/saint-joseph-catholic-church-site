  "text": "Third Sunday of Easter May 1 2022 We join in celebrating with our First Holy Communicants Zoe AnnaLynn Canaan Annie Eliza Sophia Halleigh and Ainsley as they receive their First Holy Communion this weekend May the grace of this great Sacrament help you to grow in the love of God each and every day of your life May the joy that our children receive in this Sacrament serve as a source of renewal for our own joy as we approach our Lord in Holy Communion This weekend the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Easter Though the Octave of Easter came to a close last weekend our Easter celebrations will continue as they bring us to the Ascension of the Lord forty days after Easter and Pentecost fifty days after Easter This celebration is highlighted by the placement of the Paschal Candle next to the Ambo Here the Paschal Candle serves as the symbol of the light of Christ rising in glory and scattering the darkness of our hearts and minds If you haven't yet had the opportunity to see our Paschal Candle I would encourage you to come forward to see it Beautifully painted by parishioner Nancy Wagner the candle shows the Blessed Virgin holding the Christ child with a Monstrance holding the Eucharist behind them This image unites our Easter celebration with the Incarnation of our Lord It reminds us of the true price paid for our salvation as the Blessed Mother would next hold her son in such a manner when His body was taken from the cross The Monstrance paralleling the Blessed Virgin holding the Christ child reminds us that Jesus remains with us even still in the Eucharist Matthew 2820 It also serves as a way to unite this year with our diocesan entrance into three years of Eucharistic Revival beginning first with our diocesan Eucharistic Procession this June 19th in Warsaw Our Lord continues to walk with us and shine His light into our lives each and every day Easter Egg Hunt special Thank You to all those especially the members of our Parish Council and our High School Youth Group who assisted with our Easter Egg Hunt and Parish Potluck last weekend With beautiful weather we were able to have a wonderful time collecting around 400 eggs hidden behind the Church special congratulations to those who found the golden eggs Angela Cecelia Gracie Josie Kylie Maggie Veronica and Andrew which earned a special prize These parish gatherings always serve as a great and refreshing joy Donations to Ukraine number have asked if our diocese will be taking up a special collection for support to Ukraine and aid to the refugee crisis that is ongoing While a specific collection has not yet been called for by our diocese many of the national collections that we as a diocese donate to such as Catholic Relief Services provides direct aid for many such international issues From my own discussions with those directly involved in relief efforts I would encourage you to make donations to the Knight of Columbus Ukraine Solidarity Fund The Knights is an international organization with councils throughout the world including Ukraine Donations made to this fund are directly supporting refugee relief efforts in Ukraine and the surrounding area link to this fund can be found on the parish website Feast of St Joseph the Worker This feast day of St Joseph our parish patron is trumped this year by our Sunday celebrations Though not celebrated liturgically this year it is still an important day to remember in our lives As St Josemara Escriv says this day reminds us that the greatest male Saint who ever lived was not a deacon not a priest not a bishop not a pope not a hermit not a monk he was a husband father and a worker Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday April 30 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm
