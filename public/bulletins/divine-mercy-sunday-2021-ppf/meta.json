  "text": "IVINE ERCY UNDAY PRIL 11 2021 To close the Easter Octave we celebrate Divine Mercy Sunday this weekend April 10th 11th First given this name in 2000 by Pope St John Paul II this title arises from devotion to the Divine Mercy as revealed to St Faustina Kowalska On this day we are reminded of how Gods mercy can overcome the death of the soul to sin just as Christ overcame death itself In this way we conclude the Easter Octave prepared to face the world and preach the name of Divine Mercy Jesus Christ Easter is not just an event to be remembered but is a reality that we continue living in our lives The Easter season runs for 50 days just as Christ remained on the earth for 50 days appearing to His disciples and giving them the commission to evangelize until His ascension into Heaven The 50day joy of Easter should be lived just as intensely as the 40day preparation of prayer fasting and almsgiving during Lent PDATES TO OUR ITURGICAL IRECTIVES This past Tuesday Gov Holcombs newest executive order has made significant changes to our states COVID19related precautions The same day Bishop Rhoades released the latest updates for our diocesan liturgical directives quoted as follows Regarding masking our Catholic infectious disease consultants recommend retaining that diocesan requirement which predated the states mask mandate for the time being As with all our precautionary measures the mask rule will continue to be reevaluated taking into account positive developments on various fronts of the pandemic In regards to social distancing we can begin utilizing every pew in parts of the church if this is necessary to accommodate Mass crowds as long as the pews maintain three feet of distance in front of and behind parishioners Thankfully our pews are able to meet this three feet accommodation and will allow us to begin safely increasing our churchs capacity This has become needed as more people feel safe returning to public worship especially at our 10 AM Sunday Mass which has begun to make use of our overflow seating in the Parish Social Hall Starting next Sunday April 18th we will remove the ropes between the last five pews in the back of the Church The remainder of the Church however will remain spaced at six feet intervals every other pew This means that if you would feel more comfortable having an empty pew in front and behind you please sit in the pews closer to the front of the Church We will continue to monitor attendance at each liturgy and make adjustments as needed Finally we will continue for the time being our current practice of sanitizing pews after each Mass with disinfecting wipes Given our understanding of the rarity of surface transmission of COVID19 we are looking into different disinfecting methods that can be used on our pews that will be less damaging to their finish This will most likely include the use of a spray disinfectant that can be applied to the pews inbetween Mass times Updates to come as we look more into these available options As always the updated diocesan liturgical directives are available infull on our parish website I thank you once again for your patience and understanding as we try to best follow and respect these directives given to us by Bishop Rhoades Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday April 10 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm
