  "text": "Thirthieth Sunday in Ordinary Time October 25 2020 Next weekend we will celebrate the Solemnity of All Saints at weekend Masses As this solemnity falls on Sunday it will give us a brief respite from our current journey through the liturgical season of Ordinary Time This will be reflected in our prayers our readings and our liturgical colors as the green of Ordinary Time is exchanged for the whitegold reserved for particular joyous celebrations such as Christmas Easter Solemnities and particular Feast days With this celebration we also have many events quickly approaching Next Saturday Oct 31st we will have an evening talk on the Spiritual Life at 8 PM in the Parish Social Hall At the 10 AM Mass next Sunday Nov 1st we will have our All Saints Day Dress Up Note Incense will also be used at that Mass That Monday Nov 2nd we will offer three Mass times for All Souls Day 8 AM Noon Latin and 7 PM This past Wednesday we welcomed Bishop Rhoades for a visit to our parish Each month I join with various pastors and ministers throughout Wells County as we gather for lunch and to pray together This past week we hosted the monthly gathering here at St Joseph Bishop was able to join us for the luncheon and served as a special guest speaker to the group special Thank You to parishioners Rick and Sue Singer for preparing the lunch Bishop shared several insights with the group from Fratelli tutti All Brothers On Fraternity and Social Friendship Pope Francis latest papal encyclical In the second chapter of this letter Pope Francis offers a meditation on the parable of the Good Samaritan Luke 102937 Using this meditation Bishop expounded upon our need as Christians to see all peoples as our neighbor and to be willing to give of our time and show forth the love of Christ to each person that we meet Speaking of Bishop Rhoades this past Thursday he in union with the four other bishops of the state of Indiana has extended the dispensation from the Sunday Obligation set to expire Nov 1st for the foreseeable future Bishop Rhoades and the other bishops will continue to monitor developments throughout the state and will once again reevaluate this general dispensation in the coming months What does this mean for us at St Joseph We will continue with our public liturgies while following the general safety precautions asked of us by the Bishop as we have been doing for the past several months The reason that the Bishop is extending this general dispensation is for the Faithful who might be ill who might be susceptible to illness who might be caring for those susceptible to illness and those who do not yet feel comfortable returning to large gatherings For those who fall into these cat egories it may not yet be prudent for them to return to Mass in person ei ther due to their own health or the health of those for whom they care This is of course an individual decision All are welcome to attend the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass in person In fact we look forward to the day when every one of us will be ready and able to join together again at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass in person We miss seeing those who cannot yet join us in person For those who cannot yet join us in person we will continue to live stream our daily Masses and our 10 AM Sunday Mass now greatly improved by our new live streaming capabilities Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS
