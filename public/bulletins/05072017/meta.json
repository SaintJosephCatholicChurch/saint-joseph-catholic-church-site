INVITED TO FOLLOW CHIRST THE GOOD SHEPHERD AND THE GATE TO SALVATION My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all Today is the Good Shepherd Sunday world day for prayer for Vocation It is vocation to all kinds of life but today it is for Priestly and Religious Vocation in a dis tinct way In the 1ST Reading Acts 214a 3641 After Peter has spoken to the people about 3 thousand people accepted Christ as both their Lord and Redeemer and followed him You have accepted Christ at your Baptism But this kind of acceptance is an ongoing process May I ask you Consider these questions in your mind now Is the Lord your guardian and shepherd in your daily life Are you a personal disciple of Jesus Can you sincerely and truly say The Lord is my shepherd there is nothing I shall want as it is stated in todays Psalm Psalm 23 Yes We can Christ is our gate way to freedom and security He is our gate to salvation In the Gospel Jn 10 110 Jesus Himself tells us I am the Good Shepherd I am the gate for the sheep And we are his sheep As his sheep do we hear His voice We need to pay attention to the voice of the Lord Jesus and be able to differentiate His voice from the voices of the evil one the devil false voices There are so many false voices threatening the sheep of Christ We must listen attentively to be able to recognize His voice among other voices Voices of scandalized cultures and societies The Lord Jesus Christ is calling each one of us to play a very important role in His Church As we celebrate today World Day of Prayer for Vocation you are called to pray for your own vacation and those of other people especially vocation to Priesthood Reli gious life as I have just said You are encouraged to pray for vocation every day but today we are to pray in a more serious way for Priests and Religious It was in1963 that Pope Paul VI designated Good Sheppard Sunday as world day of prayer for voca tions Jesus Christ is the Good Shepherd As His followers we are called one by one by name and are led by Him our Good Shepherd into fullness of life Do you hear His Voice We pray for fidelity to our vocations As I have said please pray every day for priestly and Religious Vocation There are always Gods blessings that come upon the families and parishes from where Priests and Religious come Our Parish needs some of them Every one of us has a very important role to play in priestly vocation Everyone here has benefited from the ministry of a priest or a religious Yes Who baptized you Who hear your confession celebrate Mass for you Priests do them for us and so their pres ence among us is very important Listen to this How would our world be today if Simon Peter and Paul did not listen and answered Christs call and became priests If Francis of Assisi Catharine of Siena Thomas Aquinas Patrick of Ireland had not fol lowed Jesus who would have preached and converted the pagans If Francis Cabrini an Italian nun was not a religious and did not come to America who would have taken care of the poor immigrants If Pope St John Paul II was not a Priest who would have touched the hearts of so many people in this world as he did If Pope Francis is not a Priest who would be our Pope today directing us to be merciful and to the life of humil ity and exceptional care for the poor and the neglected I am very happy myself being a priest Pray for vocation to priesthood and Religious life Please encourage your sons and daughters your grandchildren to answer the call to Priesthood and Religious Life Remember Heaven is for us all
