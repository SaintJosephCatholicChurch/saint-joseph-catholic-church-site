  "text": "WENTY IXTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME September 27 2020 This weekend Sept 26th27th the Church enters into the 26th Sunday in Ordinary Time St Matthew continues to prepare us for the fifth and final great discourse of his Gospel The Discourse on the End Times Over this and coming weekends Jesus will challenge the Jewish religious leaders as he offers a variety of parables referencing the judgment of Israel Matthew 2128 2214 In todays Gospel Matthew 212832 Jesus compares the religious leaders to the outcasts members of the community the tax collectors and sinners that have since responded to the call of repentance from St John the Baptist While in this life we are called to conversion which is turning away from ourselves so that we might be in relationship with another who is Jesus Christ Have we responded to this call And if so how is it evident in our life This week also brings us many wonderful feast days to celebrate On Tuesday Sept 29th we celebrate the Feast of Saints Michael Gabriel and Raphael the Archangels Traditionally this day was known as Michaelmas in reference to St Michael the Archangel and is a day to pray for protection from evil If you are able join us for Mass this day at 8:00AM to learn more about the Archangels and to join them in heavenly worship On Friday Oct 2nd we celebrate the Feast of the Guardian Angels This is a wonderful chance to teach and remind our young people and ourselves to pray the Guardian Angel Prayer and to remember that the angels of the little ones always look upon the face of my heavenly Father Matthew 1810 If you are able join us for Mass this at 8:30AM to learn more about our Guardian Angels As this coming Friday Oct 2nd is also the First Friday of the Month we will also celebrate our parish devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus with Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament from 9:00AM 6:00PM followed by our monthly evening Low Mass at 6:00PM At any point during the day please stop in to spend time with our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament As St Alphonsus de Liguori wrote in the 18th Century In the Blessed Sacrament we can talk to Jesus straight from the heart Next Sunday is the first Sunday of October a month set aside as a time for Catholics to emphasize the sanctity of human life from conception through natural death As we are each made in the image and likeness of God we are called to respect the dignity of every person In this coming month may we pray in a special way and work for the respect of all human life from conception to natural death and every moment in between As the month of October is also a month dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary I would encourage you to pray the rosary each day for this intention This past Wednesday Sept 23rd the 40 Days for Life campaign began On the northern section of our campus you will see 297 crosses staked into the ground Each cross represents a child who was lost to abortion from Wells County over the past 20 years 19982019 May we also pray in a special way for an end to the evil of abortion and for all those lives lost and families harmed by this evil For upcoming events in October We will have our informational gathering for our RCIA Sessions on Thursday Oct 1st at 6:00PM in the Parish Conference Room If you or anyone you know is interested in learning more about the Church and the Catholic Faith Id encourage you to attend We will also be resuming our monthly discussion forums In October we will be discussing the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops USCCB document Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship This guide to political responsibility prepared in part by Bishop Rhoades is rereleased every elec tion year by the USCCB This forum will be offered on Sunday Oct 11th from 830945 AM and again on Wednesday
