TwentyFirst Sunday in Ordinary Time Jos 2412a151718b Eph 52132 or 52a2532 Jn 66069 20th Sunday in Ordinary Time August 19 2018 Year As we enter into the Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time we are nearing the end of the Bread of Life discourse from John 6 Our understanding of the Holy Eucharist draws greatly from this chapter as we take the words of our Lord to heart That His flesh is true food and His blood is true drink John 655 How each of us responds to these words help determine the direction of our entire lives In our first reading from the Book of Proverbs we are given insight into a general truth about wisdom Wisdom represented here as a woman who has prepared a banquet is open to all who are willing to accept it Using the analogy given the invitation to the banquet is made we are not forced to attend In the same way while wisdom is made available to us it is still our decision to seek it out The wisdom offered to us like the banquet will fill the hunger of our hearts Yet some will still turn away and seek out folly instead Folly pro vides temporary relief from our hungers and at times appears more attractive to us than wisdom but it only leave us wanting again Folly always leaves us unsatisfied Only wisdom that can truly satisfy Understanding this which of the two wisdom or folly would we choose Placing this question in the context of our Gospel we now find our selves facing the truth of the Holy Eucharist Jesus words are quite clear His Flesh is true food and His blood is true drink In receiving Him we find eternal life and we satisfy the longing of our hearts Yet to receive Him means that we freely approach the heavenly banquet present to us at the altar of sacrifice The invitation has been made but the choice to attend and bring ourselves before God is ours to make and ours alone While we might reassure ourselves that we would never refuse this invitation we must remember in our humility how frail our humanity can be While we may not refuse the Lords invitation we may delay responding or politely decline for what seems to be a better offer We see this refusal quite clearly in the Gospel today as the crowd pre sent begins to quarrel among themselves upon hearing Jesus words Having spent the past several days freely following and seeking after Jesus they now begin to doubt their decision in following Him Jesus words are not easy for them to accept As they had begun to murmur last week they are now openly quarreling They understand what Jesus is saying but they struggle to accept it Even having seen the miracles and heard His authoritative teaching this seems too much Yet Jesus does not alter His words instead reaffirming them This invitation to the Eucharist requires trust in the Lords words and trust in the Lord Himself And as St Paul makes clear in our second reading trusting in the Lord will affect our very lives How will we respond to this invitation of trust Bringing this all together it takes on a new meaning for us and our ap proach to Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist In the Holy Eucharist which must become the very source of our lives Jesus gives Himself freely to us Are we willing to accept this great gift And if we are how will we allow this gift to change us special Thank You to all those who assisted in our various ministries for the celebration of the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary In Christ Fr David Gods heart is the most sensitive and tender of all No act goes unnoticed no matter how insignificant or small RICHARD FOSTER WEEKEND OF August 2526 2018 CANTORS 500
