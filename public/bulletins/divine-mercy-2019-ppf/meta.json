APRIL 28 2019 To conclude the Octave of Easter the Church celebrates today as Divine Mercy Sunday This feast day was instituted by Pope St John Paul II at the beginning of the new millennium and arises from apparitions received by St Maria Faustina Kowalska St Faustina was a Sister of Our Lady of Mercy in Warsaw Poland living in the early 20th Century At the prompting of her spiritual director she kept a diary of the apparitions and messages that she received from the Lord With the assistance of a local artist she was also able to create the image of the Divine Mercy that is so familiar to us today Following her death in 1938 devotion to the Divine Mercy quickly spread throughout Poland and the world Among the many beautiful devotions that have come from St Faustinas writings the Divine Mercy Chaplet has remained ever powerful This chaplet which can be prayed on a Rosary beseeches our Lords intercession as our Merciful Savior and guides each of us to always show to one another the mercy that God has shown to us This chaplet is of ten prayed at three oclock in the afternoon recalling the time of Jesus death on the cross By gazing upon the cross of our Lord and meditating upon that greatest of sacrifices He offered for us we most clearly see the Divine Mercy that we are called to imitate In recognizing the Divine Mercy poured forth upon the world through the cross we also recognize the beautiful innerworking between the Sacraments of the Eucharist and Confession In our readings today we hear of how our risen Lord enters into the lives of the Apostles and calls them back to Himself Upon seeing Him the Apostles find for giveness healing and restoration Like the Apostles we meet Christ first in the confes sional acting through His priest John 202223 and experience His forgiveness and mercy In this sacrament His mercy and peace wipe away those sins in our lives that pre vent us from full union with Him And then in the Eucharist we enter into that full com munion with Him John 656 receiving our Lord in His Body Blood Soul and Divinity No greater gift can be given to us this side of Heaven than that of our Lord Himself Continuing in our Easter joy we have many celebrations and events quickly ap proaching Next weekend we will join in the great celebration of the First Holy Commun ion of our second graders and our yearly May Crowning At the 10 AM Mass this coming Sunday ten children will receive our Lord in the Eucharist for the very first time May we keep these ten children in our prayers offering them in a special way to the protection of our Blessed Mother throughout this coming month of May As they experience this great est of gifts for the first time as they receive our Lord may we also ask our Lord to renew our own zeal each time that we receive Him in the Holy Eucharist Please Note Incense will be used at the 10 AM Mass The following week after Mothers Day Weekend we will join in the great cele bration of the Sacrament of Confirmation for our seven Confirmandi Bishop Rhoades will celebrate this Mass of Confirmation on Monday May 13th at 7 PM at St Marys in Deca tur which all are invited to attend In receiving this Sacrament our Confirmandi will receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit and like each of us will be sent out to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ As we pray for our Confirmandi let us also ask the Lord to renew in each of us the Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit that each of us received when we were confirmed May these great graces be stirred up in our souls and keep the flame of faith burning brightly in our souls If any adult has not yet received the Sacrament of Confirmation please let me know and we can work together to ensure you can receive the graces of this great Sacrament Our celebrations continue even further into Eastertide as we celebrate Sr Roses 60th Anniversary of Religious Profession with the Congregation of Sisters of St Agnes Mark your calenders for this potluck celebration on Sunday March 19th following the 10 AM Choir Mass Sr Rose has served us here at St Josephs for the past 16 years as our Director of Music and as she marks this wonderful

devotion in addition to our 8 AM Morning Mass we will also offer a special evening Mass this Friday May 3 at 6 PM This evening Mass will be offered as a Low Mass according to the 1962 Missal meaning
