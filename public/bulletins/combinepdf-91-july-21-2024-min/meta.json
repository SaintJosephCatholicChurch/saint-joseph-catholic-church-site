the Wells County 4H Fair This weekend July 20th 21st the Church celebrates the Sixteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time The Apostles sent away to preach the good news now return to the Lord and together seek a deserted place to rest and pray As often is the case however no such place was found Instead embarking from the boat the Lord and the Apostles encounter a great crowd seeking them out Our Gospel account proceeds to lead us into the introduction of the Feeding of the Five Thousand from the Gospel of St Mark This introduction focuses on the issue of leadership for God's people rather than the Holy Eucharist itself which will become our focus over the next five weekends Today though we hear how though He was withdrawing Jesus heart is moved with pity as He sees those who followed Him This great number who follow Him to a deserted place these people of a new exodus if you will are hungering Jesus is moved with pity He satisfies their spiritual hunger by teaching them many things thus gradually showing Himself the faithful shepherd of a new Israel As we are about to see Jesus will then invite His Apostles to aid Him in this role as the faithful shepherd to feed the physical and spiritual need of His people This role has continued to the modern day through the Apostles in their successors the Bishops Next weekend we begin a month long detour from the Gospel of St Mark as our focus shifts to the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St John If we were to continue our sequential walk through the Gospel of St Mark we would find ourselves at the Feeding of the Five Thousand Mark 634 44 next weekend This is actually the only miracle that is recounted at least once in each of the four Gospels save for the miracle of the Resurrection Instead of hearing St Mark's account of this miracle we will instead hear it from the Gospel of St John As we often only hear from the Gospel of St John during the Easter Season this deviation in the lectionary cycle is one of great importance After we hear this miracle account we do not immediately return to the Gospel of St Mark but instead continue our way through the remainder of the sixth chapter from the Gospel of St John The sixth chapter of the Gospel of St John contains both the Feeding of the Five Thousand and the Bread of Life Discourse In each of the three Synoptic Gospels St Matthew St Mark and St Luke there is a clear account of what is called the Institution Narratives These narratives provide descriptions of Jesus actions and words at the Last Supper This is my body This is my blood Such an account however is absent in the Gospel of St John Despite this account of the Last Supper being perhaps the most detailed John 13 17 the Gospel of St John does not directly include an institution narrative Instead the four chapters of the Last Supper highlight discipleship service unity and eternal life This is of course quite appropriate when we consider how the Holy Eucharist at Mass the true perpetuation of that which was signified at the Last Supper strengthens each of these qualities in us Transitioning from the Feeding of the Five Thousand to the Bread of Life Discourse we begin to see why there is no institution narrative in the Gospel of St John Going from feeding physical hunger our Lord begins to preach on that bread from heaven that satisfies our true spiritual hunger The Holy Eucharist Though many save for the Twelve reject and abandon Him the Lord continues His clear teaching on His Real Presence in the Holy Eucharist Quite beautifully this portion of the Gospel of St John is heard from the Seventeenth through Twenty first Sundays in Ordinary Time This means that the very middle of our three year lectionary cycle is focused upon the Holy Eucharist We hear this teaching proclaimed so clearly from the word of God so that our hearts might be better prepared to receive the very Word of God Himself Jesus Christ given to us in the Holy Eucharist special Thank you to Fr Bill Sullivan for serving as the celebrant at our Masses this past week weekend while I am attending the National Eucharistic Congress in Indianapolis In Christ Fr David PARISH CALENDAR Sat July 20 Confession 4
