the Eighteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings this week provide an emphasis on the spiritual value of poverty Taking from both the Old and New Testaments these readings remind us that human happiness is not to be found in the accumulation of material goods Ultimately riches are fleeting and empty We are called instead to store up treasure in heaven where neither moth nor decay destroys nor thieves break in and steal Matthew 620 Parish Finance Report 2024 2025 Fiscal Year At the beginning of July we closed out the past fiscal year with the diocese Our diocesan fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30 Last year as the fiscal year ended we prepared an End of the Year Report for the parish In keeping with this commitment to fiscal transparency and responsibility we have now prepared our second annual End of the Year Fiscal Report which is included in this weekend's bulletin and available on the parish website special Thank You to Michelle our business manager and Barb Doug and Rick our Finance Council for their work and guidance in preparing this report This year's report includes an expanded listing of our parish staff and information regarding both our annual diocesan tithe and the Annual Bishop's Appeal We present this report to the parish as part of our commitment to be prudent stewards of all that is entrusted to us true parish report would be incomplete if it only reviewed the fiscal health of the parish For this reason we have also included a review of the sacramental life of the parish over this past year We invite you to read through this report reflect on the blessings our parish has received and join us in praying for all that lies ahead Your continued support of prayer service and stewardship makes our parish's continued growth possible Lifewise Academy Pastoral Guidance As we near the start of the school year in all of our school districts I wanted to once again reiterate my pastoral guidance regarding Lifewise Academy This program aims to offer bible classes during school hours through time released religious instruction offered off school property As I've detailed in the past however there are a number of concerns and disagreements with this program's content in relation to our Catholic Faith To reiterate my past pastoral guidance As pastor of our parish I strongly encourage our parish families to refrain from enrolling in the Lifewise Academy program For a full review of the various concerns we've found with this program and the multiple conversations had before reaching this decision please see our parish website for the fuller Pastoral Guidance and Explanatory Letter regarding Lifewise Academy As mentioned last year after multiple attempts of dialogue it became clear that the issues we raised cannot be reconciled since the curriculum in use by this program is not open to suggestions or changes If any of our school aged families ever feel pressured to participate in this program please do not hesitate to reach out to myself and the Parish Office We are here always to support you and advocate for your family's spiritual well being I want to reaffirm that our parish remains deeply committed to the faith formation of our youth Our Religious Education Program and Youth Ministry are rooted in the fullness of Catholic teaching prayer and community life These ministries are designed to help our youth grow not only in knowledge of Scripture but also in love for Christ and His Church Our Religious Education Program 12th Grade will begin Sunday Sept 7th from 830 9:45AM Note I will be away next weekend for
