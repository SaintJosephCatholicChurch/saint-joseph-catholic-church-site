diocesan newspaper entitled Keeping Sunday Holy During the Pandemic In it he offers a variety of suggestions including attending Mass either inperson or online reading the Sacred Scriptures praying the Rosary as a family refraining from unnecessary work etc on how we can ensure that Sunday does not simply become any other day of the week He concludes by reminding us how we need Sunday as a day to worship God to rest and to celebrate joyfully our salvation in Christ We need to be renewed by the weekly commemoration of Easter Written specifically for this 32nd Sunday in Ordinary Time Nov 78 Bishop offers these suggestions as a reflection on his continuation of the dispensation from the Sunday Mass obligation for the foreseeable future As he states this dispensation is in effect particularly for the protection of those most vulnerable to serious lifethreatening risks if they were to be infected by COVID19 and for their caregivers Though our entire parish family may not yet be able to fully gather together in person we want to do all that we can to ensure that we do not remain complacent in our personal relationship with the Lord but continue to deepen this relationship Bishop does share the good news that thanks to our diocesan safety precautions there have been no known largescale instances of any virusspread in our 81 Catholic churches throughout the diocese Because of this all parishes in our diocese will continue to follow our given diocesan safety precautions As a reminder these precautions include 1 Following proper social distancing guidelines 2 Wearing a facemask or facecovering when in the Church excluding infants small children and those who would have trouble breathing if they were to wear a facemask 3 Utilizing the provided handsanitizing stations in the Church 4 Sanitizing pews after each use and 5 our continued temporary suspension on congregational singing As always thank you for your patience and understanding as we strive to offer Mass while respecting the safety precautions put into place by our Bishop As I mentioned in March while we might have a variety of personal opinions regarding these safety precautions these are given as a request from our Bishop Bishop Rhoades as the successor to the Apostles for our diocese and our diocesan spiritual father requests that we continue to follow these precautions as we gather for Mass Thank you out of respect for Bishop for following these precautions We will continue to ensure that disposable masks are available in the narthex for visitors and those who may have forgotten their masks at all weekend Masses LL AINTS AY REAT LOUD OF ITNESSES As we celebrated the Solemnity of All Saints last weekend we had many of our youth dressed as their favorite Saint At the
