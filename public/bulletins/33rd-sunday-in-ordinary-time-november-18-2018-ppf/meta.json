1833b37 ThirtyThird Sunday in Ordinary Time November 18 2018 Year We welcome Fr Dennis Di Benedeto associate pastor of St Charles Borromeo in Fort Wayne this weekend as the celebrant of our Saturday evening Vigil Mass I thank him for being with us so that I could be away to celebrate a family wedding in Michigan earlier this Saturday afternoon To all of our parishioners visitors and your families may you have a blessed and joyous Thanksgiving On this day we give thanks to God for the many blessings and graces that He has placed in our lives In my own reflections I thank God everyday for the great blessing that He has given me in our own parish family here at St Jo sephs To serve as the Father of our parish is the greatest honor and blessing that has ever been given to me As we enter our holiday week what better way to give thanks for the many blessings in our lives than to join together in worship and thanksgiving to God at the Eucharis tic sacrifice The word Eucharist itself is a Greek word that literally means thanksgiving May we come together as a parish family to start our holiday with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass offered on Thanksgiving morning Thursday Nov 22nd at 9 AM Scriptural Reflection for the 33rd Sunday in Ordinary Time As we enter into the 33rd Sunday in Ordinary Time our liturgical year is quickly approaching its end Next weekend we celebrate the Solemnity of our Lord Jesus Christ King of the Universe and the following Sunday we enter into a new liturgical year with the beginning of Advent Our readings then take an apocalyptic turn this weekend as we seemingly hear of the end times These readings are very deliberately chosen For just as we hear of the end times of all worldly things this weekend next weekend we will hear how Jesus Christ reigns above all These read ings then are to help keep our minds focused on what is truly important in this life As St John beautifully writes The world and its enticement are passing away But whoever does the will of God remains forever 1 John 217 With the introduction of the Prayer to St Michael the Archangel at the end of our liturgies our first reading Daniel 1213 may have a familiar sound to it In it Daniel speaks of a prophecy that he hears in which Michael the great prince guard ian of the Lords people will appear to defend the people of God at the time of judgment The Prophet is writing at a time of great persecution Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Seleucid Empire much of the modern day Middle East is attempt ing to hellenize Israel and force them to abandon their religious practices and follow ing of the true God Those who refused these attempts were persecuted and executed as is detailed in 1 Maccabees 14163 To Israel suffering these great trials the apocalyptic imagery of Daniel is to bring great consolation Though they suffer here now on earth their King the true God will come to save them in their faithfulness As the reading concludes the wise shall shine brightly and those who lead the many to justice shall be like the stars forever God will reward their faithfulness This apocalyptic literature continues in our Gospel Mark 132432 today Our Lord even references the Book of Daniel and the coming of the Son of Man in glory In the verses and chapter that follow our passage Jesus enters into the Pass over is betrayed by Judas and begins the final journey to Calvary and the Cross These become some of the last teachings He passes on to His disciples as He is pre paring them for the end that is to come Though they may not fully understand what is about to occur or when He will return His words to them remind them and us to always be prepared for His coming For though everything else shall pass away He shall not Jesus Christ remains the same yesterday today and always And as such living as His disciples each of us is called to always be living a life worthy of the Gospel Every aspect of our life must be united to that singular sacrifice that He has offered on our behalf as we have heard over the past six weeks in our second read ings from the Letter to the Hebrews Though we hear of the end times today we do not need to be afraid As our liturgical year shows with the coming of the end is always a new beginning As we celebrate Jesus Christ as King of the Universe and hearts we then enter into the Ad vent season to once again begin that time of waiting in great anticipation for the coming of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the beginning and the end the Alpha and the Omega If we place our full trust in Him we shall never be lost In Christ Fr
