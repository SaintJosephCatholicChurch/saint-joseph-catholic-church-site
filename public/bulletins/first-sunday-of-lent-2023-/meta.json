  "text": "First Sunday of Lent February 26 2023 special Thank You to our GIRL's Night Out for hosting our second annual Mardi Gras Fundraiser With 100 people in attendance it was a wonderful evening of fraternity in support of some great causes This weekend February 25th 26th the Church celebrates the First Sunday of Lent This season serves as our time of preparation for Easter and as we hear in the Gospel today is itself rooted in our Lord's own forty days of fasting in the desert Through His personal example our Lord re emphasizes that the practice of fasting so frequently ordered in the Old Law is to be also practiced by the Children of the New Law the Church This season is itself one that is rich in mysteries The forty days of this season not only call to mind our Lord's time in the desert but also harken back to the forty days of the flood Genesis 712 the forty years that Israel sojourned in the desert before being permitted to enter the Promised Land Numbers 1433 and the forty days during which the Prophet Ezekiel lay on his right side as a sign of the destruction that would befall Jerusalem Ezekiel 46 In addition we recall how both Moses Exodus 2418 and Elijah 1 Kings 198 fasted for forty days before approaching God on Mounts Sinai and Horeb respectively With these mysterious before us we can begin to understand why it was that the Son of God having become Man for our salvation and wishing to subject himself to the pain of fasting chose the number of forty days The Light Is On For You Tuesday March 14th This Lent each Catholic church in our diocese will have confessions available on Tuesday March 14th from 6 8 PM as a part of The Light Is On For You Campaign This yearly campaign emphasizes the beauty and availability of the Sacrament of Confession throughout our diocese If you have been away from this Sacrament for some time I encourage you to never be afraid to return to it and encounter the Lord's loving mercy and forgiveness in our lives Parish Penance Service Wednesday March 29th In addition to The Light Is On For You Campaign we will also have our Lenten Penance Service on Wednesday March 29th from 600 7:00PM We will have myself and at least three other priests available to hear Confessions throughout the hour During this time we will also have Adoration going on in the Church followed by our normal Wednesday evening Mass at 7:00PM Throughout Lent we also have our regular Confession schedule This includes Confessions offered every Tuesday from 830 9:00AM Wednesday from 600 6:45PM and Saturday from both 830 9:00AM and 400 4:45PM In addition Confession is also offered every First Friday of the month from 500 5:45PM and can always be provided at any other time by appointment Lenten Trivia The History of the Pretzel The pretzel has a deep spiritual meaning for Lent It originated as an ancient Christian Lenten bread as far back as the fourth century Throughout the Roman Empire the Faithful kept a very strict fast all through Lent No milk butter cheese eggs cream or meat Many Eastern Catholic Churches still follow some form of this stricter Lenten fast Instead they would make small breads of water flour and salt to remind themselves that Lent was a time of prayer The bread was shaped in the form of crossed arms following the local custom of crossing one's arms over the breast while praying Therefore the breads were called bracellae meaning little arms in the common Latin of the day From this Latin word the Germanic people would later coin the term pretzel Thus the pretzel is the most appropriate food symbol in Lent Even to this day the pretzel still shows the form of arms crossed in prayer reminding us that Lent is a time of prayer It consists only of water and flour thus proclaiming Lent as a time of fasting In many places throughout Europe it remains customary to serve pretzels only in Lent thus keeping this ancient symbolism alive The earliest picture and description of a pretzel may be found in an original fifth century codex preserved in the Vatican Library MASS INTENTIONS Saturday February 25 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Dale Helmer Sunday February 26
