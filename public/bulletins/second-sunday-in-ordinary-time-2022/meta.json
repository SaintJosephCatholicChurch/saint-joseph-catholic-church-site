  "text": "ECOND UNDAY I RDINARY IME ANUARY 16 2022 This weekend January 15th 16th the Church enters the Second Sunday in Ordinary Time Entering into this new Season of Ordinary Time our liturgical color as reflected in both the priests vestments and the chalice veil returns to green Green is a color that reflects growth These next few weeks of Ordinary Time are meant to help us focus on growing in our relationship with Jesus Christ Though we enter a new season our Gospel this weekend continues the theme of the Epiphany or Jesus manifestation to the world In the Magi Jesus is manifested to the Gentiles In His Baptism His divine sonship is manifested In the Wedding Feast of Cana we see the manifestation of His divine power and the beginning of His public ministry to the world This continuation serves to remind us that even as we enter into the ordinary and the everyday Jesus Christ still touches every aspect of our lives ID OU NOW HE ATHOLIC ASS IS NCIENT At the Last Supper on the night he was betrayed our Savior instituted the Eucharistic sacrifice of his Body and Blood This he did in order to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until he should come again and so to entrust to his beloved Spouse the Church a memorial of his death and resurrection a sacrament of love a sign of unity a bond of charity a Paschal banquet in which Christ is consumed the mind is filled with grace and a pledge of future glory is given to us Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy Para 47 This explanation proclaimed in the Second Vatican Council shows forth the historical reality of the Mass Instituted at the Last Supper by our Lord Jesus Christ the same Mass has continued to be offered ever since In every Mass Jesus Himself is present both in the person of His priest and under the accidents of bread and wine In every Mass His death becomes a present reality offered as our sacrifice to God in an unbloody and sacramental way As often as we assist at the Sacrifice of the Cross on the altar the work of our redemption is carried on Though testified to at the Second Vatican Council this understanding of the Mass is itself nothing new Instead it reflects the belief of the Church throughout the ages Included in this bulletin is an insert from St Justin Martyr written in the middle of the 2nd Century Speaking of the ancient practices of the Church St Justin is offering Antoninus Pius the Roman Emperor an explanation of the Christian Faith This excerpt focusing on Christian worship describes the Mass itself The testimony of St Justin Martyr however does not stand alone The early Church Fathers throughout the ages have described and reflected upon the Churchs timeless worship again and again small collection of these descriptions are seen on the bulletin cover this weekend I encourage you to dive even deeper into these quotes and the writings of the Church Fathers Through the witness of our ancestors we find the Mass to be at the center of Christian worship since the very beginning of the Church Herself ATIONAL AY OF ENANCE AND ASTING This coming Saturday January 22nd our national Bishops conference have called for a national day of penance and fasting for an end to abortion and the restoration of the legal right to life for the unborn May we lift up our prayers for this cause and continue to work towards a protection of and an assistance for of all life Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday January 15 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Andrea Grover Sunday January 16 Second
