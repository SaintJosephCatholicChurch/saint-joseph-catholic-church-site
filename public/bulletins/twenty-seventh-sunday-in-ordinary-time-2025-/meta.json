Time October 5 2025 This weekend October 4th 5th the Church celebrates the Twenty Seventh Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings take up the theme of faith both Israels faith under the Old Covenant and the faith to which we are called in the New Covenant Jesus urges us not to despair even if we feel that our faith is small or weak God can work wonders using even the smallest of things As October begins we are reminded that the entire month of October is dedicated to the Holy Rosary On Tuesday Oct 7th the Church celebrates the Memorial of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary This celebration dates back to the 16th Century and celebrates the Holy League's decisive naval victory over the invading Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Lepanto in AD 1571 This victory by the Holy League a coalition of Christian nations called together by Pope St Pius halted the Ottoman expansion into European territories Eventually it led to a peace treaty that would bring an end to the Fourth Ottoman Venetian War The battle has long since been memorialized in art poetry including such modern works as Chesterton's poem Lepanto Why though is this victory associated with the Holy Rosary As the battle drew near Pope St Pius ordered the churches of Rome open for prayer day and night He encouraged the faithful to petition the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary through the recitation of the Rosary for the victory of the Holy League When he received word of the victory he added a new feast day to the liturgical calendar The Feast of Our Lady of Victory later renamed by Pope Greogry XIII to the Feast of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary This feast day would be akin to our own Fourth of July celebrations today Yet it's true purpose is much simpler Recognizing the power of prayer In this month of the Holy Rosary may we make this prayer our own Let us take to heart a challenge issued recently by our Holy Father Pope Leo for October I invite everyone to pray the Rosary every day during the coming month for peace personally with your families and in your communities Parish Pictorial Directory Update Earlier this week I met with the regional representative for Universal Photo Directories Following our initial photos and make up photos we are now in the process of designing our upcoming pictorial directory If you did not have your photo taken but would like to submit a photo of yourself to be included in the directory please submit your photos to the Parish Office no later than Monday October 20th As a reminder those who have had their picture taken or submitted a photo will receive a free copy of the directory If you did not have a photo included in the directory we will have a small number of directories available in the Parish Office for purchase once they are completed We will also be setting aside a number of copies to be given as a part of our Welcome Packet to new parish families in the future Church Renovation Update As previously mentioned we've received approval from the diocese to contract with Shawnee Construction based in Fort Wayne for our upcoming renovations We are currently nailing down the last details for the construction contract and will hopefully have it sent to Bishop Rhoades for his signature by the time this column is printed Once Bishop has signed off we will then sit down with both the contractors and architects to set a timeline for the work
