11824 THIRD SUNDAY OF ADVENT December 15 2019 special Welcome Home to all of our university students who are back during their semester break May we rejoice together as one parish family in the Nativity of our Lord on Christmas Day This weekend the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Advent or Gaudete Sunday The word gaudete comes from the Latin verb gaudere and means Rejoice It is the first word of the Intriot or Entrance Antiphon for our Mass today which comes from St Paul Letter to the Philipians Rejoice in the Lord always Again I say rejoice Indeed the Lord is near Phil 445 We are to rejoice as we acknowledge that this penitential season will soon give way to one of great joy Advent prepares us to truly welcome the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ For this reason the priest wears rose today which mixes the violet of Advent a penitential color with the gold of Christmas a color of joy Likewise we light the third candle on our Advent wreath which is also rose This candle signifies that Jesus Christ the light of the world is like the rosecolored dawn set to appear over the horizon and overcome the darkness of the world As we rejoice looking ahead for what is to come we will return to the violet of Advent this next weekend even as Christmas draws nearer We rejoice for what is to come but we must still walk along the path to get there As a part of this preparation we will have our parishwide Penance Service this Thursday Dec 19th from 630730 PM This weeks bulletin insert offers a suggested examination of conscience one for adults and one for children that can be used to help prepare for Confession As I preached last weekend I would encourage each and every one of us to make a good Confession during the Advent season Sacramental Confession helps us to respond to St John the Baptists call to prepare the way of the Lord as we acknowledge our sins and receive the Lords absolution As St Alphonsus Liguori the 18th Century founder of the Redemptorists beautifully writes You will feel more happy at having confessed your sins than if you had been made king of the whole world Our readings over the past weekends have emphasized the second coming of Christ This will change however starting on Tuesday Dec 17th as our attention is directed towards preparing for the celebration of the Nativity of our Lord If you are able as Christmas quickly approaches I would encourage and invite you to attend and experience a daily Mass during this time Focusing on our Lord in this way will help prepare our hearts for Christmas Day Faithfully in Christ Fr David HRISTMAS ASS IMES December 24th Vigil Mass 5:00PM December 24th Mass at Night 10:00PM Please Note Incense will be used at this Mass Join our Choir singing Carols prior to Mass starting
