  "text": "LL AINTS AY OVEMBER 1 2020 This weekend Oct 31Nov 1 brings with it many different celebrations and commemorations Though we are entering into the 31st Week of Ordinary Time our liturgy this weekend celebrates the Solemnity of All Saints Nov 1st This weekend also kickoffs National Vocation Awareness Week as we pray and promote vocations to the priesthood diaconate and consecrated life On Monday Nov 2nd we commemorate All Souls Day as we pray for the faithful departed 2 Maccabees 1246 On Tuesday Nov 3rd we pray for our nation and our elected officials on Election Day And on Friday Nov 4th we celebrate First Friday and our parish devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus On Monday Nov 2nd we will offer three Masses 8:00AM Noon Latin 7:00PM for All Souls Day as we pray in a special way for all of our faithful departed As is custom our altar candlesticks cross and candles will be replaced with wooden candlesticks a wooden cross and unbleached candles The vestments worn at the Masses on that day will be the mournful color of black At the Noon Mass which will be celebrated as a Requiem Mass offered according to the Extraordinary Form we will hear the Dies irae recited prior to the Gospel and see a catafalque which is a representation of a casket in the center aisle of the nave All of these liturgical customs seen on All Souls Day are meant to help draw our entire being utilizing our senses into this prayer for all the deceased November is itself set apart by the Church as a month of prayer fasting and sacrifice for the Holy Souls Included in the bulletin is a November calendar which was also passed out to all of our RE Classes As you will see there are several prayer intentions already written on the calendar I invite you to write down the names of those who have passed away on the remaining days of the calendar And on each day spend time offering a prayer for that person or intention In this way we are able to truly set apart the whole month praying for those who have gone before us Throughout the month of November you can earn a plenary indulgence for the faithful departed by visiting a cemetery I do hope that everyone will take advantage of this opportunity to assist the Holy Souls in Purgatory speed toward Heaven Remember that to obtain the plenary indulgence in addition to the specific act eg visiting a cemetery we must also go to confession two weeks before or afterwards pray for the intentions of the Holy Father and be free from all attachment to sin If you dont quite manage to achieve that last one you will still obtain a partial indulgence Want to learn more about indulgences and the Saints and purgatory Join us for our Discussion Forum on Saints Purgatory and Indulgences next week Sun Nov 8th from 830945 AM and Wed Nov 11th from 730830 PM in the Parish Social Hall DDITIONAL IMES OF DORATION This coming week we will have several opportunities for Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament In addition to our normal adoration times Tues from 700800 AM and Wed from 600700 PM we will also have adoration on Tuesday evening from 6001000 PM Spend this time on Election Day praying for our nation and our elected civil leaders And as is our parish custom we will also have adoration throughout First Friday from 9:00AM to 6:00PM Remember time with the Lord is never wasted Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS
