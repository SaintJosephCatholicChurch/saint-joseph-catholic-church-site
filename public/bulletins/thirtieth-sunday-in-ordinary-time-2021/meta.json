  "text": "HIRTIETH UNDAY I RDINARY IME CTOBER 24 2021 This weekend October 23rd 24th the Church celebrates the Thirtieth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings continue to reflect on the cost of discipleship and faith in Jesus Christ Our faith is meant to be lifechanging It is a true relationship with a person Jesus Christ Like Bartimaeus in todays Gospel Mark 104652 we must be prepared to throw aside our cloaks and respond when Jesus calls to us Much can be said about Bartimaeus throwing aside his cloak Ultimately though in it we can see him throwing aside his old way of life his very identity as a beggar Having been called by Jesus he immediately responds Are we in any way blinded like Bartimaeus Are we like Bartimaeus willing to call out to the Lord for healing even if we are told to be silent And like Bartimaeus are we willing to trust and throw aside our cloaks when He calls us to Himself LL AINTS AND LL OULS AY The Church will be celebrating the Solemnity of All Saints on Monday November 1st As this holy day falls on a Monday the obligation to attend Mass on this day has been abrogated by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops This means that though All Saints is a holy day this year it is not a holy day of obligation in the United States Though not a holy day of obligation may we see it as a true holy day of opportunity To celebrate this feast in honor of the Church Triumphant who constantly intercede with God on our behalf we will offer three Mass times on November 1st 7:00AM Noon and 5:30PM Note Our 7:00AM and Noon Masses will be mindful of those who are attending Mass on their way to workschool Our 5:30PM Mass will include music incense and will be followed by our All Saints Day Celebration in the Parish Social Hall Immediately following All Saints Day we move from celebrating the Church Triumphant to commemorating the Church Suffering On Tuesday November 2nd we commemorate All Souls Day as we pray for all of our beloved deceased We will offer three Masses on November 2nd 8:00AM Noon and 7:00PM Before our 7:00PM Mass you are invited to join in the ground blessing at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery on IN124 at 6:00PM OR YNODAL HURCH OMMUNION ARTICIPATION AND ISSION Our Holy Father Pope Francis has called for a Synod of Bishops to occur in 2023 This Synod has been given the theme For a Synodal Church Communion Participation and Mission This theme is meant for us to reflect together on our journey as Gods pilgrim and missionary people Last weekend Bishop Rhoades opened our local participation for this synod on with a Mass at Immaculate Conception Cathedral in Fort Wayne Pope Francis has invited the whole Church to reflect on this theme He has asked Catholics throughout the world to be part of the synodal process and to prayerfully to discern Gods will for His Church at this time in history We are being asked by the Holy Father to be open to the Holy Spirit and thus discern how God is calling us towards deeper communion fuller participation and greater openness to fulfilling our mission in the world What will this discernment look like for our local Church That question is still being answered I am looking forward to seeing how our diocese will respond to this invitation from the Holy Father May we continue to pray for the whole Church as we continue to spread the good news of Jesus Christ Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday October 23 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Parish Family Sunday October 24 Thirtieth Sunday in
