  "text": "Fifth Sunday of Easter May 7 2023 This weekend May 6th7th the Church celebrates the Fifth Sunday of Easter This day is also known as Cantte Sunday due to the beginning of the Introit or Entrance Antiphon from Psalm 98 Cantte Dmino or Sing to the Lord We continue to sing to the Lord as our Easter celebration continues even as we begin to notice a shift in our Gospel readings from this weekend onward Drawing near the fortieth day of Easter and the coming Ascension of the Lord our Lord is preparing His disciples for the Ascension where He will ascend to the right hand of the Father Similar to our Gospel reading on the Road to Emmaus however the Lord never truly leaves us He remains present to us here and now in the breaking of the bread in the Eucharist Or in the words of St Maximilian Kolbe God dwells in our midst in the Blessed Sacrament of the altar He remains among us until the end of the world Congratulations again to our First Holy Communicants who are receiving our Lord in the Eucharist for the very first time Please pray for these children that their hearts may be inflamed with the love of Jesus present in the Eucharist Parish Council Nominations This past Wednesday we had our last Parish Council meeting until August Our Parish Council consists of six parishioners who each serve a three year term Every year two members cycle off the council as they complete their term This year Beth Gordon and Jeff Miller are completing their term and cycling off the council special Thank You to both Beth and Jeff for their dedication to our parish and their guidance to our council and myself over the years With Beth and Jeff cycling off the council we will have two open seats on the Parish Council to fill Next weekend we will include an insert in the bulletin that describes the duties and responsibilities of a Parish Council member and will have space to list nominations to the Parish Council When a nomination is received I will confirm that the individual is interested and willing to join the Parish Council After nominations have closed we leave the selection open to the Holy Spirit as I draw two names to determine our next two councilmembers Name That Bell Voting and Updates As seen in last weekend's insert we have narrowed down the 30 suggestions to four Saint names for the old Church bell Please submit your vote in the collection basket this weekend as our naming contest comes to a close Once the name has been selected the Verdin Company who is in the process of restoring the bell will engrave the name on the bell's face and as the last step in the restoration process tune the bell We are scheduled to have the concrete pad to support the bell poured at the beginning of June At the same time we are also working on having two flag poles ready to be installed alongside the bell which will allow us to fly both the American and the Vatican flags over our campus Parishioner Andy Vachon and local Felger Electric will be assisting with the needed electric work for this project As we move forward we will soon set a date for the blessing of the bell Summer Reading Program Starting in June we will host our 2nd Annual St Francis Summer Reading Program This program will invite our youth up through high school to read a variety of Faith based books over the summer Our readers will have the chance to earn prizes
