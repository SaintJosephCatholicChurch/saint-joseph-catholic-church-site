  "text": "OST OLY ODY AND LOOD OF HRIST ORPUS HRISTI JUNE 6 2021 This weekend June 5th6th the Church celebrates the ancient Solemnity of Corpus Christi or the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ This celebration first began in Belgium following mystical visions given to St Juliana of Lige in 1246 In these mystical visions St Juliana was tasked with encouraging her bishop to promote this feast day to increase faith in the Most Holy Eucharist Two decades later a Eucharistic Miracle occurred at the Basilica of St Christina in Bolsena as a consecrated Host bled in the hands of the priest at Mass The mystical visions of St Juliana and this miracle led Pope Urban IV to declare Corpus Christi as a feast day celebrated throughout the Church in 1264 This celebration falls Thursday after Trinity Sunday connecting us to Holy Thursday and the institution of the Most Holy Eucharist In the US this celebration has been transferred from Thursday to Sunday The Solemnity of Corpus Christi celebrates and proclaims the truth that the Incarnate Son of God having ascended to His Fathers right hand in heaven remains present and active in His Church until the end of the age Matthew 2820 In the Holy Eucharist Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself remains present to us And this Real Presence by its very nature must hold the central place in the lives minds and hearts I invite and encourage all of us to deepen our faith in the Real Presence of Jesus in the Most Holy Eucharist and to truly place Him at the center of our spiritual lives There are many ways we can do this including Attending daily Mass Spending time in Eucharistic Adoration Visiting the Church and spending time in front of our Lord in prayer Making use of the Sacrament of Confession to be best disposed receiving Holy Communion Our Bible Study on the Book of Revelation had a wonderful start this week looking at the introduction to the book Next week we will tackle the second and third chapters All

Religious Liberties looks at the interaction between the Church and the State both on a national USbased level and an international level These interactions are viewed both on the civilside and the Churchside to provide a fullencompassing overview of religious interaction throughout the world Sanctions provides an overview of Book VI in the Code of Canon Law Sanctions in the Church This book details the structures and processes in place that direct and guide juridical and criminal proceedings within the Church Providentially on the first day of our class our Holy Father Pope Francis

faith of Joseph If anxiety has its grip on you think of the hope of Joseph that descendant of Abraham who hoped against hope if exasperation or hatred seizes you think of the love of Joseph who was the first man to set eyes on the human face of God in person of the Infant conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary Let us praise and thank Christ for having drawn so close to us and for giving us Joseph as an example and model of love for Him Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI March 19 2009 Baby Bottle Fundraiser Baby Bottles will be handed out the weekend of June 1920 at all Masses
