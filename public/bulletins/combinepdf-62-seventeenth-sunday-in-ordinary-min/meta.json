  "text": "Seventeenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 30 2023 This weekend July 29th 30th the Church celebrates the Seventeenth Sunday in Ordinary Time This marks the halfway point of Ordinary Time though it may not seem that way As Ordinary Time first begins after the Christmas Season before being interrupted by Lent and Easter its thirty four weeks are fairly broken up and spread throughout the liturgical year This week brings to a close our several weekends focusing on the third great discourse of St Matthew's Gospel The Parables of the Lord From here we transition into a narrative that will focus on the formation of the disciples This narrative highlights the preeminence of St Peter among the Apostles and the use of the word church Greek ekklsia This will in turn lead us into the fourth great discourse on Church Life and Practice Next weekend we will take a brief break from this narrative to celebrate the Solemnity of the Transfiguration When this annual celebration on August 6th falls on a Sunday it takes precedence over the celebration of Ordinary Time since it is a Feast of the Lord Feasts of the Lord are specific days of the year that are distinguished in the liturgical calendar as significant events throughout the life of Jesus and as such are met with the highest of celebrations Parish Project Updates Part II When entering the narthex today you may have made the words of St Mary Magdalene at the empty tomb your own Where have you taken my Lord Over the past several months parts of the wooden statue of our Lord began to crumble and break off of the main statue Though this natural decaying process is to be expected as the statue was carved from a dead tree it has raised several pressing safety concerns surrounding the statue Last Tuesday our Knights of Columbus and several helping hands helped to safely lower and move the statue It is currently being stored in the pole barn for further inspection We will be cutting away some of the loose wood at the base to see what condition the overall statue is in If salvageable it is my hope that we can place the statue somewhere on our campus where it is both visible and safe Speaking of statues our parish recently received a statue of St Isidore who is the patron saint of farmers and rural communities This statue will be placed in a small outdoor shrine out near the garden boxes behind the Church St Isidore is one of several Saints that I hope our parish will learn more about in this coming year It never hurts to have friends in heaven Did You Know The Sacrament of Holy Matrimony The Sacrament of Holy Matrimony is a covenant The term covenant always expresses a relationship between persons The marriage covenant refers to the relationship between husband and wife a permanent union of persons capable of knowing and loving each other and God As the celebration of marriage in the Catholic Church is a liturgical act a wedding involving a Catholic is to be held in a Church unless the local bishop grants a dispensation allowing otherwise In this Sacrament the outward sign is found in the consent exchange between husband and wife Differing from the other Sacraments Holy Matrimony has itself been elevated from a natural institution to the dignity of a sacrament as seen during Jesus public ministry This sacramental nature was instituted by Jesus as He worked his first miracle at a wedding John 31 11 and taught that marriage in the New Covenant is permanent and holy Matthew 193 9 In the Sacrament of Marriage God gives the couple the grace to make their own His love mercy generosity kindness and compassion By their marriage the couple now witnesses to Christs spousal love for the Church One of the Nuptial Blessings in the liturgical celebration of marriage refers to this in saying Father you have made the union of man and wife so holy a mystery that it symbolizes the marriage of Christ and his Church special Thank You to Fr Bill Sullivan who will be offering
