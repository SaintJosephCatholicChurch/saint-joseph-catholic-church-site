Bishops Appeal serves to facilitate the many different ministries programs and services offered by our diocese Our generous response to this appeal helps to further the spread the Gospel and the love of Jesus Christ to those in need within our community throughout northern Indiana Next weekend we will have the opportunity to view several of the ministries that the Bishops Appeal supports and see how these min istries help to change lives for the better There will be more information regard ing the Bishops Appeal in next weekends bulletin In our first reading Isaiah 3547a the author of the text is most likely writing during the Babylonian Exile which falls six hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ At this time Israel has been decimated and the Israelites taken in captivity to Babylon The words from Isaiah are meant to be reassuring to a peo ple who are in despair The Israelites having suffered such great loss are yearning for freedom and a return to their homeland This prophecy then reminds them of the promise of God to His chosen people He has not abandoned Israel in their exile but will instead save them and return them to their homeland The imagery presented in both Isaiah and our Psalm Psalm 146610 especially the physical healings described are understood by the people of Israel to be signs that will be performed by the coming Messiah Just as God will free Israel from the Babylonians His anointed one will free Israel from all oppression and limitations both political and physical and usher in Gods Kingdom As the Israelites believed that physical limitations were the result of a sinful life the res toration of the body spoken of by Isaiah also represents a spiritual healing in Gods Kingdom And in this Kingdom there will also be new life as symbolized by the pools and springs of water in Isaiah Through their trust in God all things become possible In our Gospel Mark 73137 we see these messianic prophecies come to life in Jesus Christ The prefigurements of the Old Testament truly become incar nate and are fulfilled in Jesus And in this instance we are invited to see the true compassion of our Lord as he tenderly cares for this man The physical healing He brings about opens this mans whole life to a newness he did not know before We can then begin to understand the excitement of not only this man but all those who saw this miracle and could not keep quiet The word Mark records in his Gospel Ephphatha is from Jesus native tongue of Aramaic We ourselves would have heard this word spoken to us in our baptism as the priest blessed our ears and our mouth as he said this word Just as the man in our Gospel today had his ears and mouth opened by the Lord the Eph phatha said at our baptism signifies our openness to hearing and proclaiming Gods Word Like the man this openness offers us a whole new life now based in Jesus Christ As we put on the new man Ephesians 424 through the waters of baptism we find ourselves united together in the one Body of Christ Acknowledging that we are one in the Lord St James uses our second reading James 215 to remind us how we are to live this reality In Jesus Christ there can be no discrimination or division among His body Instead we are to rec ognize one another as we are before the Lord as equals and to love one another as brothers and sisters Through Jesus Christ this unity not only becomes possi ble but in the Church becomes a reality In living this reality we preach the Gos pel message not simply by our words but through our actions Through our love and care for one another Let us ask ourselves today how we can continue to foster this unity in Christ Looking at our personal relationships where do we find divi sion and what can we do to instead foster unity
