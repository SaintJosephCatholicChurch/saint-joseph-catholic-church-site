  "text": "Thirty Second Sunday in Ordinary Time November 6 2022 special Thank You to those who assisted with our All Saints Day and All Souls Day celebrations this year As you can see on this weekend's bulletin cover the week was full of a number of prayerful and fraternal activities special Congratulations to our All Saints Day Costume Contest Winner St Anthony of Padua James This weekend November 5th 6th the Church celebrates the Thirty second Sunday in Ordinary Time Though our secular culture will be eager to move us prematurely towards the coming Christmas celebrations our liturgical calendar reminds us that these celebrations are still a ways off This doesn't mean we can't begin to enjoy Christmas music movies and decorating but that we are called to remember the coming season of preparation Advent Writing in 1966 our National Conference of Catholic Bishops now the USCCB lamented that the season of Advent had unfortunately lost in great measure the role of penitential preparation for Christmas that it once had They hoped that through meditation on the lessons taught by the liturgy then Advent will again come into its own Its spiritual purpose will again be clearly perceived That is preparing not simply our homes and our hearths but our hearts to welcome Jesus Christ Though being mentioned now we are actually still two whole weekends away before the start of Advent Continuing in Ordinary Time our liturgical year will come to an end in two weekends with the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe Until then we will continue to hear the challenging call to discipleship and are reminded of our true homeland Heaven All of this especially in this month of November is meant to appeal to the Christian imagination that the unseen is not as distant as our culture may have us believe May we move at our own pace in the coming weeks allowing Jesus Christ to always remains our true focus Annual Bishop's Appeal Thank you to everyone who has made a pledge on behalf of our parish to the Annual Bishop's Appeal If you have not yet made your pledge you can go online to make your pledge at diocesefwsborgaba Meeting and exceeding our goal will help support the placement of a permanent altar at our new cemetery Thank you for your commitment and your generosity The Bells of St Joseph Part II In addition to upgrades to our carillon system the Bells of St Joseph also has a second meaning The steeple bell from the original church on Cherry Street is in the process of returning to our parish campus in the coming future This bell cast in 1902 is a direct link to our parish being served as a mission parish of St Aloysius The bell was given by Fr RJ Denk the outgoing pastor of St Aloysius to our parish and Fr HA Hellhake the incoming pastor The bell remained in the steeple of the old church for many years after our campus moved to its current location Those who used the building after it was decommissioned as a Catholic church eventually stopped ringing the bell for fear that the steeple might collapse under its weight Though considered a small bell it weighs over 600 pounds With permission of the building owner the bell was eventually removed by the Goodwin family who wish to donate the bell back to our church in memory of their late parents parishioners Carl and Melba Goodwin After much research and discussion we will be working with the Verdin Company to repair and restore the bell The Verdin Company was the original company who cast the bell 121 years ago though the warranty has long since expired The bell will be prominently displayed at ground level on our campus as it is too heavy for our steeple and will be usable though not swingable thanks to an electronic striker that will be installed inside the bell

get their picture taken for the New Parish Directory It only takes a few minutes after Mass Flood Ravages the Homes and Farms of Over 1000 People in Lokoja Diocese Nigeria Fr Louis Fow o y o I am Fr Louis Fowoyo from the Diocese of Lokoja Kogi State Nigeria I am presently assigned to St Gaspar del Bufalo Rome City as the Pastor I thank Bishop Kevin Rhoades for the opportunity given to be able to do this mission appeal in order to share with you what people are suffering now in the area in which I come from I thank the Office of Catholic Charity of the diocese of Fort Wayne South Bend that has approved my appeal for me to do this mission I am also grateful to your Pastor Fr David Violi for allowing me in the Parish of St Joseph Catholic Church Bluffton Indiana OKOJA IOCESE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS MISSION The people of the diocese are predominantly peasant farmer They do not hav e the means of a mechanized farming They still farm using the implements of hoes and cutlasses This makes it difficult for them to be able to have a large farm and they barely produce enough to feed their families during the year With that you will unde rstand that they cannot have surplus for keep for a raining day Also they do not have a means of preservation even if they have surplus Theirs is a matter of from hand to mouth as we describe it That is whatever you produce is consumed immediately That is why annually they work hard to produce food to feed families send children to school buy their basic needs in life and still maintain shelter and other things of life HE EASON FOR THIS PPEAL Political Insecurity in the Land The country during the past years has been experiencing insecurity in one form or the other The unrelenting growth of this challenge gives the impression that it is organized The minimal action taken by the government on this issue is giving the impression also that they are involved or that they are supporting the people who are participating in making the c ountry insecure As a result of the insecurity in the land people are been kidnapped on a daily basis women are raped and killed the people the citizens cannot sleep at any time of the day with their two eyes closed This insecurity is perpetrated by Bandits Boko Haram groups local kidnappers and thieves and unfortunately sometimes government law enforcement agents are pointed to as allegedly aiding these groups Horrific f loods as a result of the raining season this year Nigeria has two large rivers rivers Niger and Benue that run's through the middle of the country to the southern part into the Atlantic Ocean The rivers during the raining season often overflow their bounds This is what we experienced this year Anytime we have flo ods as a result of the overflow of the rivers farmers are affected and families have to relocate and stay with their relatives and friends until the end of the season From ne of the priests working in the flood affected area We have a pathetic situat ion here in Koton arfe and Lokoja For days now there is a total gridlock No going out or coming in Most of our parishioners shops and houses are submerged in water No light no water We are really suffering here We need prayers and help But the g overnment is insensitive to the plight of the people Our church and primary school have become a refugee camp Food scarcity is im minent Their farms are totally washed away We shall appreciate any support from you Mass cannot be offered in all the over 30 outstation churches because of the flooding In fact most of the mud building churches and houses are completely washed away Almost every year the Catholic Diocese of Lokoja helps the people in some way to provide I nternally isplaced eople's IDP camps for the people in our schools churches and Reverend Fathers residences This year the people are experiencing such a massive displacement that the diocese cannot cope alone with the problems That is why the diocese is appealing to generous people like you to help in whatever way you can to solve the problems at hand I thank you very sincerely for your assistance to so many people many of whom I know personally because I worked in those areas affected I can only imagine their frustrations now that this has happened to them at this very critical time I thank you I thank you And I thank you for your generosity Whatever you give will go a long way to help the diocese ser ve the people of God in the area Fr Louis Fowoyo Bishop Martin Olorunmolu Bishop of Lokoja <a href=\"tel:(260)557-9103\">(260)557-9103</a>
