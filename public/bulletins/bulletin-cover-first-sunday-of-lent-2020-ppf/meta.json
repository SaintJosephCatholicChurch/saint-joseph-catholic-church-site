  "text": "First Sunday of Lent March 1 2020 special Thank You to our Parish Social Committee and all those who helped setup and host our Parish Game Night and Euchre Tournament this past Saturday What a wonderful parish family we have As we enter into the first full week of Lent we will hear in todays Gospel reading Matthew 4111 of our Lord spending forty days in the desert During this time He is faced with great tribulations and temptations from the devil himself After these forty days our Lord returns from the desert and begins His public ministry This also begin His journey towards Jerusalem and ultimately the Cross Entering into the sacred season of Lent we unite our journey with our Lords forty days in the desert Utilizing our three spiritual weapons of prayer fasting and almsgiving we embrace selfdenial so that our focus may always be on Christ Himself As St Catherine of Siena beautifully said in the 14th Century If we lose ourselves on the cross it is there that we will find ourselves entirely We have been made for heaven These forty days are meant to help remind us of that Everything in this life is meant to help prepare us for life in the world to come For this reason we will strive to grow in our discipline over these next forty days As a parish we will have the opportunity to live this season of Lent together in several ways Every Friday our weekly Soup Suppers 530 to 6:30PM and Stations of the Cross 7 PM offer us a chance for both fraternity and prayer This Friday March 6 we will be hosting a free showing of The Passion of the Christ in the Parish Gym at 7:30PM As it is also First Friday we will also have a period of extended adoration this Friday from 8:30AM to 5 PM The front of the bulletin also includes our daily Mass and Confession times throughout the week I pray that all of these different opportunities will serve to help you in your Lenten journey And of course the Church is open at all hours as a place of prayer before our Lord Himself in the Blessed Sacrament After Ash Wednesday there was one question I was often asked Whats different with the candles Throughout the Lenten season we will be using unbleached beeswax candles which have dark caramel color Unbleached candles serve to remind us that without the grace of Baptism we are mere creatures of the Earth without the aide of sanctifying grace On Easter as the bleached candles return it will also remind us that we ourselves like the candles have been washed clean in the Blood of the Lamb and shine with the radiance of faith In a similar way our wooden candlesticks in place of our gilded ones offer the same noble reflection Parish Updates Next weekend we will hold our monthly discussion forum on both on Sunday March 8th from 845945 AM and Wednesday March 11th from 745845 PM after the 7 PM evening Mass in the Parish Social Hall Our discussion topic will be on the Churchs teaching regarding Gender Identity and Transgenderism All are welcome and invited to join us in our discussion Starting on Monday March 2nd a local group will be hosting a weekly adult basketball pickup game in the Parish Gym from 8 to 9 PM Adults 18 are invited to join in
