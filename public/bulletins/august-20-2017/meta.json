AUGUST 20 2017 YR From the Pastors Desk ALL PEOPLES ARE INVITED TO WORSHIP GOD AND SHARE IN HIS DIVINITY My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all Everybody is invited to come to God and share in Him as His sons and daugh ters It is a universal invitation and call But the problem of the syndrome of I am bet ter than you triumphalism has stained the human race including the Church We must do our best to see that we are better than them we are right they are wrong com plex do not jeopardize our salvation Thanks to St Pope John XXIII who through the Vatican Council II opened the windows and strove to do away with ghetto mentality Belonging to Gods chosen people does not mean that we are necessarily better than other people who follow their own good conscience seek God in a unique way Todays readings show an openness in love and respect for others The opening prayer of today liturgy shows Gods open invitation It says God your care extends be yond the boundaries of race and nation to the heart of all who live May the walls which prejudice raises between us crumble beneath the shadow of your outstretched arm So for God all are welcome to His Kingdom It is Justice and Salvation for all Thus in the 1st Reading Is 561 67 Prophet Isaiah tells us that God welcomes any one Jews and Gentiles alike No discrimination Thus said the Lord The foreigners who join themselves to the Lord ministering to him them I will bring to my holy mountain and make joyful in my house of prayer for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples You see that Gods house is for all of us I hope you are working seriously to be there And in the Gospel Mt 152128 Jesus by receiving the Canaanite woman a pagan who has tremendous faith shows universality of Gods invitation and acceptance into His Kingdom for all who did his will Jesus apparent rejection of the woman was in tentional It was used by the Lord Jesus to teach us the importance of faith And that the Kingdom of God is for all of us Nobody is excluded except the one who excludes one self from the Kingdom We all are invited to imitate the faith the trust and great humil ity of the Canaanite woman Listen to this Jesus said to the woman It is not right to take the food of the children and throw it to house dogs If you were the Canaanite woman what would you have done In great prudence and humility and trust she said to Jesus Please Lord for even the dogs eat the scraps that fall from the table of their master Wonderful Then Jesus Exclaimed woman great is your faith Let it be done for you as you wish And instantly the womans daughter was healed from that hour Great Wonderful Amazing So Heaven is for us all What are you really doing about it God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it NB 1 We are organizing Marriage Encounter Parish Based Please register quickly 2 We are also planning a Pilgrimage to
