have their proper time of sensitivity which should be exploited for their good learning As it is for children so it is true for every human person In Greek two words express time One is chromes which means time measurable in days weeks months or years such as Spring Summer Fall or Winter Another word is Kairos Kairos means time of opportunity time of grace This is the Time I am talking of Kairos It is Easter time It is special time for us all We need to be grateful to God You must thank God for this time It is time of favor time of blessings time of forgiveness time for reconciliation time for making peace time to love It is time when Christ is present to us One of such time is today here in this Church God is present with us in a unique way In the 1st Reading from the Acts of the Apostles 7 men were chosen men full of the Holy Spirit and Wisdom If we are to choose 7 people from this congregation to represent us in Rome before Pope Francis will you be one of the seven Will you be the first person to be chosen If your answer is no then you must do something about it for you are supposed to be the first among the seven to be chosen Or at least one of the seven And to be chosen you must possess the quality described in the 2nd Reading by Peter the First Prince of the Church the First Vicar of Christ on earth Precious in the sight of God is a holy person a consecrated nation people set apart That is what you must be You are called to be princesprincesses sharing in the Royal Common Priesthood of Christ By Baptism you are a priest sharing in the common priesthood of Christ And thus you need to be conscious of the state in which God called you and chose you Thus you can now see that you are in a venerated position Therefore you must be conscious of this your position and be appreciative to God the Lord Jesus Christ who set you on such elevated position Your actions modus vivendi modus loquendi and modus Operandi must match the state in which we found ourselves Chosen People of God Holy people Consecrated people In the Gospel we read that Christ is the way the truth and the life It is only when you recognize accept and behave honorably in accord to your elevated holy position will Christ Jesus be the way the truth and the life for you So you need to be conscious of your holy state in life as a child of God and behave accordingly to gain eternal
