  "text": "SIXTH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME February 16 2020 Next weekend we will have our Parish Game Night following the Saturday vigil Mass Saturday Feb 22nd at 6 PM Make sure to signup in the Narthex if you havent already I hope to see you there for an eve ning of fun and fellowship This week will be the last full week before we enter into the season of Lent beginning on Ash Wednesday February 26th The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass will be celebrated on Ash Wednesday at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM As we continue to approach the Lenten season have we already begun to pray about what God is calling us to do this year How will the three Lenten pillars of prayer fasting and almsgiving enter deeper into our lives and bring us closer to God this season Our yearly Lenten journey is meant to strengthen us anew in the spiritual combat that we daily face against the three temptations that our Lord Himself faced in the desert Matthew 4111 the devil the flesh and the world This journey is not one to be taken alone For this reason we will have the opportunity to gather together often as a parish family both for the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the many other liturgies and devotions offered to us by Holy Mother Church Every Friday during the season of Lent join us for our Parish Soup Supper from 5:30PM 6:30PM in the Parish Social Hall and Stations of the Cross at 7:00PM in the Church On Friday March 6th after Stations of the Cross we will host an opening showing of The Passion of the Christ in the Parish Gym This 2004 film depicts the last twelve hours of our Blessed Lords life as He approaches His crucifixion in Jerusalem One of the greatest weapons in spiritual combat is the Sacrament of Confession As it is described by St Thomas Aquinas In the life of the body a man is sometimes sick and unless he takes medicine he will die Even so in the spiritual life a man is sick on account of sin For that reason he needs medicine so that he may be restored to health and this grace is bestowed in the Sacrament of Confession As we continue our preparation toward Lent I greatly encourage you to plan to make use of the Sacrament of Confession especially if it has been some time since youve last availed yourself to this Sacrament Throughout the season of Lent we will have many opportunities when the Sacrament of Confession will be available On March 10th our diocese will participate in The Light is On for You campaign when the Sacrament of Confession will be offered in every parish from 600 8:00PM We will also offer our weekly Confession times every Tuesday from 830 9:00AM every Wednesday from 600 6:45PM and every Saturday from 400 4:45PM In addition to these times we will also be hosting our Lenten Penance Service date to be announced and additional times throughout the season of Lent as will be announced in the weekly bulletin This great Sacrament of Gods mercy should become a frequent part of our spiritual life In addition to these opportunities and at the suggestion of the Parish Council we are in the process of planning a 3Day Parish Mission as well as a Novena to St Joseph our Patron More information to come of these and other opportunities as we near the Lenten season I look forward to seeing how God will work in our Parish this Lent Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday February 15 8:00am Special Intention 8:30am Rosary
