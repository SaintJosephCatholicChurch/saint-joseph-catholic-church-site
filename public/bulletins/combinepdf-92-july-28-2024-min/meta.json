20 24 Jn 624 35 Seventeenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 28 2024 This weekend July 27th 28th the Church celebrates the Seventeenth Sunday in Ordinary Time We now find ourselves at the beginning of the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St John where we will remain over the next several Sundays Starting with the Feeding of the Five Thousand this weekend we will then move through the Bread of Life Discourse over the next four weekends as our Lord proclaims His Real Presence in the Holy Eucharist How providential it is that we arrive at this part of our three year lectionary cycle's focus on the Holy Eucharist immediately following the conclusion of the 10th National Eucharistic Congress Desiring to bring forth eucharistic revival in our country we hear of how the Lord comes to bring us something greater than mere food He comes not only to nourish the body but the soul as well This nourishment is the Real Presence of the Holy Eucharist The 10th National Eucharistic Congress was an experience beyond words Even though it had been over eight decades since the last Congress was held the excitement for this event was palpable Four eucharistic processions sent from the four corners of our country and walking over 6000 miles arrived in Indianapolis to begin the Congress Over 60000 Faithful converged at Lucas Oil Stadium and throughout Indianapolis for several days of events Each day offered various opportunities for Mass prayer speakers and community Similar to past world's fairs there was a large expo hall with over 1200 booths overflowing with information about all aspects of Catholic life Each evening Lucas Oil Stadium was filled as the Faithful gathered to hear speakers join together in praise and worship and most importantly spend an hour with our eucharistic Lord in adoration Each evening as our Lord in the Holy Eucharist was processed into the stadium the crowd fell silent This silence remained each evening throughout the Holy Hour stadium often filled with cheering crowds rooting for their favorite sports team or reveling in their favorite musical artists fell silent as the King of Kings made His presence known With 60000 in attendance the prayerful silence was electric as we were simply in His presence These moments of revival could not be kept to the stadium or the adjacent convention center Instead it spilled out into the streets as the eucharistic procession brought our Lord from the stadium to the Indiana War Memorial Tens of thousands both filled and lined the streets in praise of Jesus Christ Finally the closing Mass challenged those in attendance to be sent out as missionaries sent from the crossroads of America back to their hometowns Bringing forth the graces of the Congress this revival seeks to kick off a Year of Mission in the Church in the United States The focus of this year is simple Walk with One What this means is that there is someone in your life right now whom Jesus longs to call to Himself He wants to spark a relationship with them and bless them with His sacraments And He wants YOU to be His instrument in the life of this person Will you respond Memorial of Bl Solanus Casey On Tuesday the Church celebrates the Memorial of Bl Solanus Casey This celebration however will only occur liturgically in the four dioceses in which Bl Solanus lived In addition to our diocese as Bl Solanus lived at St Felix Friary in nearby Huntington this celebration is also celebrated throughout Green Bay St Paul and Minneapolis and Detroit Having lived in Huntington from 1946 1956 Bl Solanus is a modern day soon to be Saint with a local connection At least several parishioners have shared memories of meeting Bl Solanus when attending Mass at the friary in Huntington Bl Solanus was a simple Capuchin Franciscan and served as the porter or doorman at the friary being the first to greet all visitors Given this local connection I encourage you to learn more about the life of Bl Solanus It is my hope that in the coming year Bl Solanus is one the Saints that we have the chance to grow closer too Faithfully in Christ Fr David <a href=\"FORMED.ORG\">FORMED.ORG</a> Our Parish Code 7N68MY Weekend of
