  "text": "FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT OVEMBER 29 2020 Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas even though Advent has only just begun As we prepare our homes and our hearths for the coming Christmas season let us never forget to prepare our hearts for Christ These four weeks of Advent are meant to serve as a penitential and preparatory time During this time we await both the yearly celebration of the Nativity of Jesus Christ on Christmas Day and the Parousia which is the second coming of Jesus Christ at the end of time Jesus Christ has come into the world and He will come again The season of Advent is meant to both look backward at the Incarnation and forward to the second coming For this reason our readings over the next four weeks will be broken into two sections For the first three weeks of Advent our readings focus first on the second coming of Jesus These readings will call us to repentance and conversion preparing our hearts to always be ready for Christ For the last eight days of Advent our readings will then focus on our celebration of Christmas Day itself These readings will be taken from the infancy narratives of the Gospels of both Sts Matthew and Luke filling our hearts with expectant joy as we prepare to celebrate the Incarnation The penitential and preparatory themes of Advent are reflected not only in our readings but throughout our whole liturgy Over the next four weekends we will not recite the Gloria a prayer of joy at Mass Our altar crucifix and candlesticks have been replaced with our simple wooden crucifix and candle sticks with unbleached beeswax candles The priest will wear violet vestments Throughout Advent even the Churchs adornments and ornamentation take a muted tone All of this is meant to help enter us into this spirit of preparation to receive for the Lord Jesus Himself Revelation 320 Our Advent preparation itself is one of great spiritual value Jesus desires to grow within our soul During Advent I would encourage you to make use of the Sacrament of Confession Within this sacrament the mercy of God heals the wounds that sin has inflicted upon our soul Through the healing of our woundedness we are able to be more open to Jesus love Confessions are scheduled every Tuesday from 830 9:00AM Wednesday from 600 6:45PM and Saturday from 4:00PM 4:45PM Confessions are also always available by appointment Throughout Advent we will also have several other opportunities to prepare our hearts for the coming of Jesus Christ This includes the chance to participate in our Advent Food Drive helping to provide for those in need within our community Matthew 2535 We will also have the opportunity for a brief retreat with our upcoming Advent Parish Mission Mark your calendars and plan to attend either inperson or livestream each evening at 7 PM from Monday Dec 7th through Wednesday Dec 9th As we enter into our Advent preparations we must also never lose sight of what and who we are preparing for All of this preparation is made so that we are prepared to rejoice as we celebrate the birth of our Savior In the Church times of preparation always gives way to the joy of Jesus Christ As a part of our parish preparations we want our parish campus to reflect the light of our joy throughout the Christmas season I invite you to join us on Saturday Dec 5th at 9 AM following the 8 AM morning Mass to help string Christmas lights throughout our campus that will be lit throughout the Christmas season Many hands will make quick work of this project Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday
