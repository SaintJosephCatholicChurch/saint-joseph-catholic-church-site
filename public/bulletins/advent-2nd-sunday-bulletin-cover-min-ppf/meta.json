SUNDAY OF ADVENT December 8 2019 Last weekend our Holy Father Pope Francis visited the Italian town of Greccio where the first Nativity scene was created by St Francis of Assisi in the 14th Century After visiting he released a very insightful letter reflecting on the tradition of the nativity scene He encouraged the beautiful family tradition of preparing the nativity scene in the days before Christmas He continued saying Great imagination and creativity is always shown in employing the most diverse materials to create small masterpieces of beauty As children we learn from our parents and grandparents to carry on this joyful tradition which encapsulates a wealth of popular piety It is my hope that this custom will never be lost and that wherever it has fallen into disuse it can be rediscovered and revived Echoing the Holy Fathers sentiment I would encourage each of our families to continue the beautiful tradition of the nativity scene in our own homes Just as our large nativity scene will appear in the Church soon enough we should also keep this beautiful reminder of the coming Christmas season in the forefront of our homes We can even build it up over these coming weeks so that it culminates with the placing of the Babe of Bethlehem the Christchild on Christmas morning In making this a family tradition we keep the building and expectant joy of Christmas always in our sight and as such in our minds and hearts as we approach the joy of Christmas Day ARISH PDATES With the year ending we are concluding many of our projects The last of our older parking lot lights were switched to LED fixtures last weekend and new spotlights were added to the campus entrance bringing our exterior lighting project to a close special Thank You again to Electric and parishioner Andy Vachon for their dedicated work in bringing this project to completion The parts necessary for our interior lighting projects have arrived and Zap Electric has begun the transition of our sanctuary lights to LED fixtures The Sanctuary may seem darker over the next two weekends while the various fixtures are being replaced but I know that you will be very pleased with the end result The use of LED fixtures offers increased visibility are more energy efficient being a benefit both environmentally and economically and require less frequent maintenance compared to our older fixtures I thank you for your patience as this project nears completion Our Parish Census Survey has had a wonderful response Of our 212 Registered Parish Families weve received around 120 responses 57 Thank you for your participation Ive had a chance to personally read each response and there have been many great suggestions made I look forward to incorporating many of these suggestions into our parish planning for the future After our site visitation with the Next Generation Parish NGP Staff and several conference calls weve decided that it would not be the right time for St Josephs to participate in this program The NGP Staff were very impressed with what they saw at our parish and where we are headed and do not want to risk slowing down our momentum Lori from the NGP Staff offered her thanks for the warm welcome she received during her visit and ask that we keep those parishes participating in this program in our prayers Faithfully in Christ Fr David Reminder Our first monthly Young Adult Gathering Ages 1840 will be next Sunday December 15th at 5 PM in the Parish Hall I hope to see you there The Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception celebrated on December 8th is the patronal feast of both our country and our diocese The Second Sunday of Advent however takes precedent this weekend and the solemnity is celebrated on Monday Dec 9th Because of this the Immaculate Conception is not a holy day of obligation this year Though not an obligation let us consider it a Holy Day of Opportunity and gather together in celebration at one of the Masses on Monday at both 8 AM and 5:30PM WEEKEND
