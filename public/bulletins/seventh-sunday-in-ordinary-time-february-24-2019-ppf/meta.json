said I am every day more convinced that happiness in heaven is for those who know how to be happy on earth As we are created by God we are created to know and love Him This is the deepest longing of our hearts It is this desire for love that directs our very lives It is only when we finally recognize that God is love 1 John 48 that we realize He is who we are truly longing for So often we stop short of that love of God and find a lesser love which is fleeting in temporal things Our hearts though will only find rest in Him When we live our lives entirely for Christ we find true and unending joy and happiness Our readings today serve to remind us of this truth We live for heaven As St Paul beautifully expounds in our second reading 1 Corinthians 154549 we are being transformed ever more closely into the Body of Christ Each and everyday is a chance to grow deeper in love and relationship with Jesus Christ And as we grow closer to Him we begin to look more and more like Him Our will becomes even more entwined with His Selfish concerns begin to die away as we place them upon the Cross and are no longer beholden to them We see this exemplified by David in our first reading 1 Samuel 262 79 1213 2223 Though King Saul has unjustly sought Davids life David following the Lords will spares Sauls life He places his trust and his very life entirely into the Lords hands as he spares the life of one seeking to kill him This trust exceeds worldly expectations In the same way our Lord Himself challenges us in the Gos pel today Luke 62738 to this same trust Having given us the Beatitudes He now explains how to live them out in our lives This requires going beyond worldly ex pectations As PopeEmiritus Benedict XVI once said The world offers you com fort But you were not made for comfort You were made for greatness The love God calls each of us to is a love that exceeds all expectations Yet in that love we experience God Parish Projects Update Our various parish projects are continuing to move forward The proposal submitted to the Diocesan Building and Improvements Committee regarding our Parking Lot Project has been accepted and we have received approval to move forward We look forward to working with Brooks Construction Company in the coming months to repave our parish parking lot special Thank You to our Building and Grounds Committee Finance Council and Parish Council for their continued work and guid ance in helping to bring this project to fruitrition Though discreetly placed you may have noticed our newly installed security cam eras focused on the exterior entryways to the Parish Offices and the Church The diligent work of Stylus Technologies has helped to bring about this first step in our Church Security Project We are currently in the process of receiving bids both for a security door between the Church and parish offices and for improved interior lighting within the Church as we move forward with the next phases of security plan Over the past three weeks weve also experienced two unexpected repairs on the campus The first is an issue you may have noticed with soot collecting on the north Church wall We are currently working with Dunwiddie Heating and Plumping to determine the source of this issue and how to best resolve it Once weve isolated the problem we will go about either cleaning the wall or if necessary having it re painted The second unexpected repair happened last weekend as the water heater serving the lower level of our religious education classrooms began to leak Thankfully due to the diligence of our parish staff and several parishioners this was caught almost immediately and prevented any major water damage to our building The water heater being nearly 20 years old and beyond repair was replaced earlier this week Thanks to your generosity towards the Rainy Day Fund we as a parish are in a solid financial position to address these unexpected repairs as soon as they arise Your continued generosity to the Rainy Day Fund on the first Sunday of each month will help ensure the upkeep of our parish buildings for years to come In Christ Fr David Let all that you do be done in Love 1
