Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception a holy day of obligation The Blessed Virgin under this title is the patroness of both our diocese and our country giving us even greater reason to celebrate this solemnity The best way to crown our celebration is by joining together in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass To help fulfill our obligation to assist at Mass on this holy day our Masses for the Immaculate Conception are offered as follows Thursday Dec 7th Vigil Mass 7:00PM Friday Dec 8th Mass 7:00AM Noon 7:00PM This weekend December 2nd 3rd the Church starts a new liturgical year of God's grace as we enter into the First Sunday of Advent Having walked through the Gospel of St Matthew this past year we will now begin anew our walk with the Lord through the Gospel of St Mark This Gospel was written to a primarily Gentile audience demonstrated by their unfamiliarity with Jewish customs cf Mark 73 4 11 sometime shortly before the destruction of the Temple in AD 70 Given the brevity of the Gospel of St Mark being the shortest of the three synoptic Gospels we will also have an opportunity to hear from the Gospel of St John normally proclaimed throughout the Easter Season right in the middle of this liturgical year Quite beautifully this jaunt into the Gospel of St John takes us through the Bread of Life Discourse and our Lord's clear teaching on the gift of the Eucharist How appropriate that our entire three year lectionary cycle keeps us centered on the Eucharist Advent though a brief season is one of great importance As the world and our culture has already embraced the secular holiday season we recognize in Advent that Christmas is not yet here We are only now beginning our preparations not simply for a holiday but for the holy day that welcomes the birth of our Savior May we not lose sight of this important season of Advent in our desire to welcome Christmas Day The prayer on our bulletin cover taken from the <a href=\"Hallow.com\">Hallow.com</a> App's Complete Guide to the Season of Advent offers a simple way to invite God's calming presence in our lives amid the many distractions of the season We can see these good things as foretaste for the true joy that awaits both on Christmas Day and on the last day when we are face to face with the Lord Himself For this is the true purpose of both the Advent season and the entire liturgical year To prepare us for Christ Liturgically we welcome this preparation by embracing several seasonal penitential practices First we deprive ourselves of the Gloria which is a hymn of praise Like the Blessed Mother we are called to hold these words in our hearts and ponder them Luke 219 throughout Advent until Christmas Day We do see a brief reprieve from this practice however on the upcoming holy day As it is a solemnity we once again sing out the Gloria on that day as a brief a glimpse reminding us of what we are preparing for Second our normal candlesticks and bleached candles are replaced by wooden candlesticks and unbleached candles These adornments in the sanctuary help us to recognize the simplicity and penitential nature of the season Lastly the vestments chalice veil and adornments of the sanctuary are violet This liturgical color is meant to symbolize the penance sacrifice and preparation we undertake during this season These various elements of preparation remind us that we are preparing for something Advent prepares us for Christmas Our life is meant to prepare us for Christ Christmas is not just a day but an entire season In the same way life with Christ is not simply a moment but an eternity We are made for heaven And this liturgical year is made to help us get there Let us use everyday of it as a chance to grow closer and closer to Christ In Christ Fr David PARISH
