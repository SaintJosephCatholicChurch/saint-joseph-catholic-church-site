  "text": "Twenty Ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time October 22 2023 This weekend October 21st 22nd the Church celebrates the Twenty ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time Though we are continuing our walk through the fifth narrative of St Matthew's Gospel we may notice a thematic shift in our Gospel readings starting this weekend Having focused on the parables of the Lord over the past several weekends we now turn our focus to His direct engagement in a series of controversies with the Jewish religious leaders This focus will continue until we enter in three weeks time into the fifth and final discourse of St Matthew's Gospel This discourse will predict both the destruction of the Temple in AD 70 and the end of time And it will do so by providing us with two final parables from the Lord one of which The Parable of the Ten Virgins is even depicted in our stained glass windows as you enter the Church This will then lead us into the end of the liturgical year as we celebrate the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe As the liturgical year comes to a close we will prepare for the new liturgical year with our Forty Hours Eucharistic Devotion Starting with an evening Mass on Monday Nov 27th at 7 PM we will enter into an extended time of Eucharistic Adoration that will conclude with an evening Mass on Wednesday Nov 29th at 7 PM Throughout these three days we will be joined by Fr Daniel Steiner from the Diocese of Nashville who will offer eucharistic reflections at both of the Masses and at a special conference on Tuesday Nov 28th at 7 PM This devotion is not only meant to lead us into the new liturgical year but to serve as a kick off for the National Eucharistic Revival happening throughout our country This year will culminate with Eucharistic Processions coming from all four corners of our nation to start the Eucharistic Congress in Indianapolis this coming July Starting for us with our Forty Hours Devotion in November may we pray for a renewed personal encounter with Jesus Christ particularly through the transformative power and mercy of Jesus in the Holy Eucharist Annual Bishop's Appeal Update We are making progress toward our goal for the Annual Bishop's Appeal Thank you to everyone who has already submitted your pledge and for those who are still to do so thank you for prayerfully discerning how the Lord is calling you to support of His local Church This annual appeal is critical for the financial health not only of our Diocese but also of our parish After receiving the final results from last year's Appeal we exceeded our goal by a substantial amount That amount returned to our parish supported the construction of the new altar that will soon be placed at our St Joseph Catholic Cemetery on State Road 124 Just as we exceed last year's goal it is my belief that working together we will have no problem doing so again We are also continuing to strive for 100 parishioner participation Church Heating System Update As a follow up from last weekend's update the part we have been waiting on for our boiler system arrived on Friday Oct 20th We are scheduled to have the part installed this coming week Once installed and if no other complications arise our heating system in the Church will be turned in time for Masses next weekend Once turned on the system will remain on until the Spring special Thank You to local Dunwiddie Heating AC Plumbing for their upkeep of our boiler and heating systems All Saints Day and All Souls Day At the start of November the Church will celebrate the Solemnity of All Saints a Holy Day of Obligation on November 1st and the Commemoration of All Souls on November 2nd To assist with our obligation to attend Mass on the holy day we will have four separate Mass times offered vigil Mass for
