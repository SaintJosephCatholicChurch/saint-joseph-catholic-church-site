ORDINARY TIME YEAR July 8 2018 Our relationship with God is exactly that relationship It is a conversation be tween us and God Without this conversation there can be no relationship In this way we are called to both speak to God and to listen to Him speaking in our lives In our readings this weekend we see different aspects of this conversation In our first reading we hear of the calling of the prophet Ezekiel At this time Is rael had fallen away from their relationship and broken their covenant with God The prophet Jeremiah who lived during the time of Ezekiel was sent to call Israel back to God but they would not listen Eventually Israel was conquered by King Nebuchadnezzar and many Israelites were taken captive to his kingdom of Baby lon Ezekiel was among those forcibly carried away to Babylon Having been taken captive Ezekiel is called by God to prophesy to the remnant of Israel living now in Babylon Though Ezekiel is told that the people may not re spond to his message God sends him still Even if His people turn away from and reject Him God strives to continue His relationship with His chosen people and with us today No matter the response they may give God is always there waiting for the return of His people In our second reading we hear from St Paul as he writes a second time to the church he has founded in Corinth Paul is facing opposition in Corinth by those challenging his authority as an Apostle It is implied that Paul is speaking not for God but only for himself Paul however reassures the Corinthians that he is speaking not on his own behalf but truly as a messenger of God To this end he describes how God has kept him humble so that he is not tempted to pride Paul through this thorn in his side is reminded daily of his own personal weak nesses And in recognizing his weakness Paul recognizes that he needs help from another that he needs God In remaining faithful to his relationship with God Paul becomes strong We are people called to relationship and it is only when we are in that relationship that we like St Paul are able to thrive Finally coming to our Gospel reading we see Jesus entering His own town and being rejected They reject Him because they know Him Jesus is in this moment too ordinary to be the Messiah They will not listen to or even enter into a conver sation with Him And because of this they will never truly know Him If we like those who reject the Lord today are unwilling to even enter into con versation with Him we too will not know Him Instead if we are willing to give even a moment to Him to spend time each day in dedicated prayer speaking and listening to God we begin to build up our relationship with Him And we will see how this changes our lives Knowing God no longer as a stranger but as a friend and our Savior In Christ Fr David SCRIPTUREMASS READINGS FOR THE WEEK Mon July 9 Fourteenth Week in Ordinary Time St Augustine Zhao Rong Priest and Companions Martyrs Hos 21617b182122 Mt 91826
