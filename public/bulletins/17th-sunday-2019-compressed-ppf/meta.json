2019 We thank Fr Lane for his ministry and presence at St Josephs this past month and wish him Gods blessing as he prepares to return to Mount St Marys Seminary for a new academic year His ministry as a seminary for mator aids not only the Church throughout our country but our diocese in a particular way as he helps to educate and form a majority of our future priests May he know of our prayers and gratitude for this ministry to Christs Church In our Gospel today Luke 11113 we hear of three lessons that our Lord shares with His disciples about prayer In the first lesson Jesus teaches the disciples how pray through the Our Father In the second He describes the need for persistence in prayer And finally He emphasizes the effectiveness of prayer As the disciples walk with Jesus throughout His ministry and learn from Him He continually calls them to enter into a deeper spiritual relationship through prayer This call has not ceased since it was first made Jesus calls each of us to enter into a deeper personal rela tionship with Him through prayer Like the very first verse of our Gospel we need to make time in our day for prayer Those moments of quiet where we speak to the Lord the deepest yearnings of our hearts and where we in turn remain in the quiet and peace of His presence It is especially in those moments when we feel we have no time to pray in the day that we need to pray most of all As our Lord modeled to his disciples most especially the Apostles as they were with Him so long each of us is called to spend time in prayer each day priest is no exception Our bulletin cover depicts a place that I spent many hours in prayer both this summer and throughout the past dec ade It is one of my favorite photos from the May Crowning at the National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in Emmitsburg MD This statue of the Blessed Mother overlooks Mount St Marys Seminary where Fr Lane instructs and where I spent six years in studies for the priesthood The seminary has been forming priests for our country since its founding over two hundred years ago Founded in 1805 by Fr John DuBois Mount St Marys has a spe cial connection with our own diocese Fr Simon Brut joined Fr DuBois as an instructor at the Mount only seven years after it was founded Fr Brut would eventually leave the seminary after being named the first bishop of the Diocese of Vincennes out of which our own Diocese of Fort WayneSouth Bend would eventually be formed Mount St Marys is also home to the Sisters of Charity and their founder St Elizabeth Ann Seton the first nativeborn American to be recognized as a Saint Our Ladys Mountain has for over two hundred years served as a prayerful site for so many It has been a true joy over this summer to have the opportunity to revisit this prayerful site where my relationship with Jesus Christ was deepened throughout my seminary years Speaking of seminary and priesthood our diocesan Vocation Office will be hosting a Come and See Retreat for all men Grade 10 and up who would like to learn more about priesthood and seminary life The re treat will be on Saturday August 10th from 10 AM to 6 PM concluding with Mass at Sacred Heart in
