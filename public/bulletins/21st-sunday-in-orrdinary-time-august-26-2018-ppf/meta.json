Entering into the 21st Sunday in Ordinary Time we come to the end of the Bread of Life Discourse from the sixth chapter of St Johns Gospel Next week we will return to St Marks Gospel which we will remain in until we enter into the new liturgical year Year of our threeyear cycle of the Gospels at the beginning of Advent But today we keep our focus on the words of our Lord to the crowd that has been following Him over our past several weeks As the crowd has come to realize Jesus words are often quite challenging and <a href=\"un.com\">un.com</a> fortable for them and us to hear He does not however change or alter His words Instead He calls us to greater faith In our first reading Joshua 2412a 1517 18b we hear the conclusion of the Exodus journey Israel having been freed from slavery in Egypt had jour neyed to and settled in the promised land In this passage then we are at the very end of this moment in Israels history Joshua serving as Moses successor has led Israel into Canaan and settled the promised land Having reestablished Israel as a nation and dividing the land among the twelve tribes Joshua now gathers the tribes to renews Israels covenant as Gods chosen people As Joshua looks back upon the many times that Israel strayed from the Lord during their journey he now calls them to faithfulness in renewing their covenant Modeling this faithfulness Joshua reconfirms his personal and familial commitment to the Lord and invites all others in Israel to do the same Though he himself has suffered many trials and hardships he still is able to faithfully and boldly proclaim As for me and my household we will serve the Lord And then having completed his journey and reaching an old age Joshua is returned to the Lord his Master and is buried in the promised land In our second reading Ephesians 52132St Paul writing to the Church in Ephesus calls for greater unity among the Church As we are all united together in Christ through our baptism this call for unity starts at the most basic unit The Family St Paul uses this moment then to speak to the relationship be tween husband and wife This loving union must imitate the love of Christ and His Church that is of total selfgift and sacrificial love between spouses Through this imitation husband and wife form an intimate relationship mirroring that of our triune God This relationship like Christ on the Cross for His Church requires immense trust and the willingness to open oneself completely to another Like Christ and His Church we can often find such a relationship uncomfortable and challenging but the love shared between husband and wife calls them to have faith in one another as we have faith in Christ Keeping this faith can be challenging as we see in our Gospel John 66069 today Those who were following after the Lord including many who had come to belief as disciples left Him when His teachings became too challeng ing They returned to their former way of life forsaking all that they had found in Christ Yet the Apostles his closest followers remained As St Peter states they remain not because of any greater insight or spe cial knowledge but because they have faith They truly believe with their hearts that Christ is the Holy One of God In this faith they have found the desire of their hearts in Jesus Christ Though they may struggle to understand or be shaken at times they have put their trust completely in Him And trust in the Lord is never misplaced Through this trust Christ works to sanctify His Church each and everyone of us This requires much work but will ultimately lead us to true joy As Christ has given Himself over completely to us how will we renew our faith and trust in Him today In Christ Fr David Bishop Kevin Rhoades will celebrate Mass com memorating the 60th
