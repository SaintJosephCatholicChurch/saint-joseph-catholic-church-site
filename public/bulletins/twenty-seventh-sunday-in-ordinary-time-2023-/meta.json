  "text": "Twenty Seventh Sunday in Ordinary Time October 8 2023 This weekend October 7th 8th the Church celebrates the Twenty seventh Sunday in Ordinary Time We continue in the fifth narrative of St Matthew's Gospel as we hear the Parable of the Tenants which offers an allegory of both the relationship of Israel to Christ and how we are tenants to the gifts of God The Parish Picnic proved to be a great afternoon last Sunday With wonderful weather and 150 in attendance this was one of our largest parish social events in recent memory Congratulations to our Chili Cook Off Winners 1 Kevin Stout Sr 2 Carol Butler and 3 Christie Felger Our Cornhole Tournament Champions Thiago and John Calduro And our Door Prize Raffle Winners Twilla Herr Greg and Stacy Lehman and Lauren Andrews special Thank You to Michelle Paxton and Stacey Coulardot from our parish staff for planning this year's event as well as the many volunteers who helped make everything possible One aspect of living out our Faith is not only going out into the world but also building up relationships from within An event like this helps to strengthen bonds between parishioners and invites individual families into a deeper connection with our entire parish family Our next upcoming parish celebration will be our All Saints Day Party on Wednesday November 1st following the 6 PM Mass for the Holy Day Mark your calendars and make sure to join us for this annual celebration of the Saints Prayer Service Day for Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Since 1998 next Sunday has been nationally observed as the annual Day for Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance To commemorate this day we are partnering with the two local funeral homes in Bluffton and offering a service to where we remember and support those affected by pregnancy and infant loss We will be hosting this Memorial Prayer Service on Sunday October 15th at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery at 2 PM This service is open to all parishioners and all those from throughout our county The Memorial Prayer Service will include the opportunity to place memorial butterfly ornaments at the cemetery that will remain through All Souls Day November 2nd These memorial butterfly ornaments will be available in the narthex and at both of our local funeral homes throughout this week This will afford those who may not be ready to attend a public service the opportunity to place their own butterfly ornaments at the cemetery privately Memorial Prayer Service Sunday October 15th at 2 PM Address St Joseph Catholic Cemetery 2980 State Rd 124 Bluffton 37th Annual Bishop's Appeal This weekend marks our kick off for the 37th Annual Bishop's Appeal This yearly collection helps to support a variety of ministries and outreaches offered by our diocese throughout northern Indiana Your support of this appeal also aids our own parish as anything raised above our yearly goal is returned directly to the parish Pledge cards can be returned to the Parish Office or placed directly in the weekend's collection basket As a reminder this year's appeal video is available for viewing on the parish website Continuing Education Days This week the priests of our diocese gather at Pokagon State Park for our annual Continuing Education Days This year's conferences will focus on our human formation with a series of presentations from the Saint Paul Seminary Institute for Ongoing Clergy Formation These presentations will focus on how our human character serves as the foundation on which the spiritual life is built or as theologians would say grace builds on nature Please pray that this week's conferences will help each of us to grow in our humanity so as to be better instruments for God's grace in and through our priesthood Please Note Due to the Continuing Education Days we will not have daily Mass this Wednesday Oct 11th or Thursday Oct 12th Saturday October 7 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am Confession 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm
