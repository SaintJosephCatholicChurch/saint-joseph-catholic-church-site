October 5th following the 5 PM Mass nice fall evening spent with our parish family praying partying and playing games What more can we ask for special Thank You to our Social Committee for helping to select the date and for leading the charge on this great event More information to come as we approach the date I look forward to see ing you all there If all goes according to plan when you arrive for Church next weekend you will be driving on a newly paved and lined parking lot Brooks Construction is scheduled to begin work on Monday Aug 19th and complete it before the end of the week Libys Stripe Right is planning to follow right behind Brooks Construction to restripe the parking lot If due to weather or scheduling issues striping is not able to be done this week I thank you ahead of time for your patience and diligence in park ing next weekend It will be a great joy to see this project which began before I even arrived at St Josephs last year brought to completion special Thank You to our Building Board Committee Members Oscar Heyne Doral Smith Joe Baur and Dan Sudhoff for their work on this project over the past year Weve also received wonderful guid ance from both our Parish Council and Finance Committee as we moved forward on bidding the project and tremendous assistance from Rick Singer who has been over seeing our work with Libys Stripe Right And of course this maintenance project would not have been possible without your generosity to our parish especially through the Parish Rainy Day Fund Thank you for your trust and financial support to our parish It is my prayer that we always serve as prudent stewards of all that God has given us As our parking lot project nears completion I wanted to provide updates on three of our other ongoing projects We will hopefully very soon have devices avail able to offer hearing assistance throughout Mass Having reviewed a variety of ap proaches to provide this assistance weve given the go ahead to Stylus Audio Video to move forward with this project We will be making available individual lis tening devices used with earpieces that are synced to and amplify the Church sound system To start we will have four individual devices available for each Mass and if there is a greater need we will be able to add even more devices to the same system More information to come when the system is installed Electric Company Inc is also moving forward with the designs for increased lighting on our parish campus This will be a wonderful move to help en sure both the security and safety of all those who are on the parish campus at various times of day especially in the winters As a reminder when driving through the park ing lot please be mindful of the concrete pylon bases that have been installed Finally we are also moving forward with our interior lighting project In the past several years the lighting in both the nave and narthex of the Church was changed to LEDs We will now be completing this transition as the lighting in the sanctuary will also be changed over to LEDs This will ensure that we are being both more energy efficient and environmentally conscious There is also the added benefit of providing greater security as the Church will be better lit by these new fixtures We are working with ZAP Electric and Kendall Electric formerly Wabash Electric for this project and hope to see it completed in the coming months I am excited to see these projects Thank you for your support as we strive to be pru dent stewards for our Churchs future With these improvements to our campus our next step will be making sure that we are making the most of the campus as well We have a beautiful church and beautiful grounds that will always be open as a place for prayer and to encounter the Lord Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF AUGUST 2425 2019 CANTORS 500 Leeann Kennerck 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Larry Leitz LECTORS 500 Ginny Fenstermaker 730 Ben Wagner 1000 Monica Harris
