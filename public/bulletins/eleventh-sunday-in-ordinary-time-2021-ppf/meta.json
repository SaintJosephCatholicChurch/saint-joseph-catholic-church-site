  "text": "LEVENTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME UNE 13 2021 Though we have been out of the Easter Season for the past three weeks we are only now seeing a return of the green of Ordinary Time Following our last two weekends that celebrated the Solemnities of the Holy Trinity and of Corpus Christi the Church now enters into the Eleventh Sunday of Ordinary Time this weekend June 12th 13th Throughout Ordinary Time we will continue to walk with our Lord through the Gospel of St Mark During this time we are called to grow in the moral life Or as St Paul describes to attain to the unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God Ephesians 413 RADUATE ASS This weekend we celebrate and pray for our high school graduates At todays 10 AM morning Mass our graduates join us in their caps and gowns as we congratulate them on their graduation and ask the Lord to bless them as they enter into the next stages of their lives We will conclude this Mass with a special blessing prayed over our graduates May we keep each of them and all of our students in our prayers At this time of year I always call to mind the words my childhood pastor shared with us at our graduation Stay close to the Catholic Church and you will be at peace As I would later learn his words were not his own but were paraphrasing the words of St Padre Pio Stay close to the Catholic Church at all times for the Church alone can give you true peace since She alone possesses Jesus the true Prince of Peace in the Blessed Sacrament May each graduate always know this true peace of Jesus in their lives ATHER AY ABY OTTLE AMPAIGN Next weekend our nation celebrates Fathers Day to recognize the great gift that is fatherhood In honor of this celebration in this Year of St Joseph we will be partaking in the Baby Bottle Campaign to support Helping Hands Pregnancy Center Our Knights of Columbus will be passing out Baby Bottles in the narthex after each Mass next weekend We invite you to take a Baby Bottle home and over the next month fill it with spare change Helping Hands is one of several local organizations that our parish supports in their outreach to families right here in our community All proceeds from the Baby Bottle Campaign will go directly to Helping Hands Baby Bottles can be returned in the collection basket each weekend or to the Parish Office during the week REE ONTHLY OOKS IN THE ARTHEX At the beginning of each month both Our Sunday Visitor and TAN Books offer sales on a variety of books I often find several titles mixed in with these monthly sales that are interesting and at the reduced price entirely affordable This is often a great chance to update my own bookshelf as well as the shelves in our parish library To get the sale price however requires purchasing several copies of each book When making a purchase I take one book for my shelf one for the parish library and place the remaining books in the narthex Feel free to help yourselves to these books Once you finish one please pass it along to fam ily and friends who would appreciate it This months releases include Where We Got the Bible Our Debt to the Catholic Church The Catholic Faith An Introduction to the Creeds and Pocket
