  "text": "FIFTH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME February 9 2020 Today the Church celebrates the 5th Sunday in Ordinary Time Prior to Pope St Paul VIs revision of the liturgical calendar in 1969 this day was called Septuagesima Sunday Septuagesima is the Latin word for seventy and this weekend means that we are only 70 days away from Easter Sunday This and the next two weekends were traditionally observed as a time of intentional preparation preparing for the coming of Ash Wednesday and the beginning of the Lenten season As Lent is that period of forty days to excite in our hearts the spirit of the Christian vocation it is not a season to enter into lightly and without preparation With the beginning of Lent only three weekends away and in the spirit of Septuagesima Sunday this is our opportunity to begin our Lenten preparations Just as a builder would not rush into a project without first having blueprints or design ideas so we should not rush into Lent without a plan We even see this concept of preparation reflected in our readings today and in the coming weeks As such we are called to prayerfully discern how we will approach the coming Lenten season using the Sacred Scriptures as our guide Each set of readings over the next three weeks offers us reminders of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ Our first readings from the Old Testament remind men of what God has commanded His holy people to do help those in need act justly and love neighbor as yourself Our second readings from St Paul highlights how Gods grace will strengthen and unite us in this outreach to others And finally our Gospel readings exemplify how we as Christians have a responsibility by our faith and actions to strive towards righteousness Taking all of this together we are challenged to be disciples of Jesus Christ in both word and deed This coming Lent serves as a chance to renew this commitment and grow in desire for our Lord May we use these next few weeks wisely to discern how we will approach this season Im excited to see what the Lord has in store for our parish this Lent Sacramentals Blessed Salt and Holy Water On the Feast of the Epiphany we gave away Epiphany Chalk which is a sacramental used to bless ones home In the life of the Church this is but one of many sacramentals available to us from Holy Church This may raise the question What exactly is a sacramental As we know a Sacrament is an outward sign instituted by Christ to produce grace in the soul sacramental is not a Sacrament though sacramentals bear a great resemblance to and help remind us of the Sacraments sacramental is a sacred sign such as a prayer an action or an object that signifies effects particularly of a spiritual nature which are obtained through the intercession of Holy Church They are handed down to us through Holy Church and so often make use of everyday things chalk water salt etc to remind us of how Jesus uses even the most common of things to show forth His glory As with the worship of Holy Church these objects engage our bodily senses so that we may present even our bodies as a living sacrifice Romans 121 to the Lord Every part of us and every part of our lives is to be given over to God Available in the Narthex are bottles of Holy Water and vials of Blessed Salt Please see the insert to learn more about these sacramentals Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS
