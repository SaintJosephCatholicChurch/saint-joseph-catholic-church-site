Third Sunday of Lent March 3 2024 This weekend March 2nd 3rd the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Lent As we enter March it is worth note that this month is dedicated to our parish patron St Joseph Though devotion to St Joseph is evident in the early Church through the dedication of churches under his patronage as early as the 4th Century this dedication of the entire month of March most likely comes from the establishment of his feast day on March 19th in the 15th Century St Joseph remains an amazing Saint to grow in a deeper relationship with especially during the Lenten season In the words of St Josemara Escriv This greatest male Saint who ever lived was not a deacon not a priest not a bishop not a pope not a hermit not a monk He was a husband father and a worker Though we hear little of St Joseph in the Sacred Scriptures his quiet life following after the will of God is a great example of how to live out Lent Additional Confession Opportunities This Thursday March 8th from 600 8:00PM our diocese is hosting the annual The Light Is On For You Campaign During this diocesan wide Lenten offering all eighty one parishes of our diocese will be offering the Sacrament of Confession at the same time This time is offered in addition to our normal weekly times Tuesdays from 830 9:00AM Wednesdays from 600 6:45PM and Saturdays from 830 9:00AM and 400 4:45PM In addition to this extra opportunity for Confession we will have another additional opportunity coming up with our parish's Lenten Penance Service on Wednesday March 20th from 600 7:00PM Following the wonderful response seen during the Advent season we will have myself and four other priests available to hear Confessions during the penance service Following the penance service we will have our weekly 7:00PM Wednesday evening Mass The Scrutinies Starting this weekend our eight Catechumens and Candidates for Full Communion will be invited forward at Mass to participate in the Scrutinies These rites occurring over the third fourth and fifth Sundays of Lent date back to some of the earliest days in the life of the Church The Lenten season is and always has been first and foremost a time of preparation for those who are seeking to enter into the Church Since at least AD 500 the Gospel readings for the Scrutinies come from the Gospel of St John This means that for the next three weekends our readings will come from Year even though we are in Year of our lectionary cycle Each of these readings offer a special focus on the call to conversion spoken of in each Scrutiny The Gospel readings especially offer a powerful depiction of the hidden transformation that God desires to accomplish in our lives The practice of the Scrutinies is meant to remind us all that the light of Christ comes to pierce the darkness of sin and to bring new life As a parish family we join with our Catechumens and Candidates for Full Communion in prayer throughout the Scrutinies As they prepare to be welcomed into the Church we similarly ask for a renewal of baptismal grace and an increased zealousness in our relationship with the Lord Holy Card of Bl Carlo Acutis One of the highlights of our pilgrimage this past week was our time spent in Assisi Here we not only had the opportunity to pray before the tombs of both Sts Francis and Clare but also Bl Carlo Acutis This millennial was beatified by Pope Francis in 2020 and his cause for canonization remains ongoing He held a special affinity for Eucharistic Miracles including creating an entire website dedicated to documenting such miracles throughout the world Though he desired to visit many of these miracles in person he was unable to do so after being diagnosed with leukemia Despite his trials he offered his suffering to God for the sake of the Church His motto is one with imitation To always be close to Jesus that's my life plan In the narthex there are holy cards of Bl Carlo from Italy as a small gift to our parish In
