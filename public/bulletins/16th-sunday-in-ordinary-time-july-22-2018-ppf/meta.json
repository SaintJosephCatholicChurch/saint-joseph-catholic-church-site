anyway helped with the Mass with Bishop Rhoades this past Saturday including our choir the church decorating committee the Knights of Columbus those who helped clean the church and those who helped prepare and clean up for the reception following the Mass In our first reading the prophet Jeremiah is preparing Israel for the coming fall of Jerusalem and the nation Throughout his years of prophesy the kingdom of Judah falls to the Babylonian Empire and the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar installs his own ruler Zedekiah over Judah Zedekiah will serve as the last ruler of Judah before the temple is destroyed Jeremiah using the imaginary of the shep herd cautions Zedekiah to not seek his own will but the will of God If Zedekiah serves as a shepherd who thinks only of himself and not the flock given to his care he faces only doom and destruction ahead Though Jeremiahs prophecy might seem alarming he does conclude with a message of hope God Himself will appoint a true shepherd and king to lead His people And as the Psalmist poetically recites when the Lord is our Shepherd there is nothing I shall want In Gods own time we see these prophecies ful filled in Jesus Christ the Good Shepherd and King of the Universe In our second reading St Paul reaffirms this good news as he shows how Jesus Christ brings unity to His whole flock Speaking to the Church in Ephesus St Paul is writing to a predominantly Gentile audience His message in this epistle however is universal All of us Jew and Gentile alike are reconciled to the Father and united as one in the body of Christ As Jeremiah had prophesied we no longer have anything to fear as we are saved through Jesus Christ our true Shepherd and King by His sacrifice on the Cross It is this same sacrifice which brings us together time and time again as we are united to that moment through the cross at the altar in every Mass Finally in our Gospel we see our blessed Savior united to this imagery of the shepherd by St Mark As His Apostles return to Him from their missionary work they withdraw together to a deserted place While Zedekiah in our first reading only looked after the wellbeing of himself Jesus is instead looking after the well being of His followers as they seek a place to rest a while Yet crowds followed them even there Jesus did not simply turn them away Instead He was moved to help them As the Good Shepherd Jesus gathered His flock and he cared for and fed them He cared for them by ensuring they found rest and He fed their spiritual hunger through His teachings In the same way the Good Shepherd still gathers His flock today as He calls each and every one of us to Himself As we gather for the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass He invites us to rest in His presence free of the worries of the world and He feeds us with His very Body and Blood in the Holy Eucharist As Good Shepherd He gives Himself entirely for us How will we respond to this great gift and how will we imitate the Good Shepherd in our own lives In Christ Fr David SCRIPTUREMASS READINGS FOR THE WEEK Mon July 23 Sixteenth Week in Ordinary Time St Bridget Religious Mi 61468 Mt 123842 Tues July 24St Sharbel Makhluf Priest Mi 714151820
