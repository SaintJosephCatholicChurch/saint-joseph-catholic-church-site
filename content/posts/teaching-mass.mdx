<p>On Thursday, September 8th, we will offer a &ldquo;Teaching Mass&rdquo; in the Church from 7:30 &ndash; 8:30 PM. This event is being offered as a part of our Catholicism Explained Program. All are invited to join us to learn more about the Mass.</p>
<p>Note: A &ldquo;Teaching Mass&rdquo; is not an actual Mass. Our daily Mass that day will be offered at it&rsquo;s normal time: 8:00 AM.</p>
<p>Instead, a &ldquo;Teaching Mass&rdquo; is a chance for us to walk-through, ask questions about, and explain the various parts of the Mass in a more in-depth manner.</p>
