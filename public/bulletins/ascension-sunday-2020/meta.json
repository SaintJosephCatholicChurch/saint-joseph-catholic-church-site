  "text": "OLEMNITY OF THE SCENSION May 24 2020 This weekend the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Ascension Normally this day is referred to as Ascension Thursday as it falls exactly 40 days Acts 13 after Easter Sunday In our diocese however it has been transferred to the nearest Sunday The number forty is one of great importance throughout the Scriptures often describing the amount of time it took to accomplish an act united to Gods will In the Book of Genesis it rained for forty days and nights as Noah was on his ark In the Book of Exodus Israel journeyed for forty years in the desert to the promised land In the Acts of the Apostles Jesus ascended after forty days giving those witnesses of his the time to confirm their faith in His resurrection In the same way our yearly season of Lent lasts forty days as we strive to respond to the Lords call to conversion turning away from sin through the spiritual weapons of prayer fasting and almsgiving Our Easter season however does not end at forty days It continues for another ten days following the Ascension as we await for the Solemnity of Pentecost The fifty days of Eastertide continued the faith formation of those who had just entered the Church in a period known as Mystagogy meaning to be led into the mystery On Pentecost we celebrate the descent of the Holy Spirit and are reminded how we are now sent out on mission to proclaim the Gospel Having encountered the risen Christ throughout the Easter season we are called to sing out Hallelujah and share our joy with all those around us ARISH PDATES Back on
