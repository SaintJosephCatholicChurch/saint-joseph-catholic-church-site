2024 This weekend August 17th 18th the Church celebrates the Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time We continue walking through of the sixth chapter of St John's Gospel focusing on the Bread of Life Discourse In this chapter Jesus continues to emphasize His Real Presence in the Holy Eucharist My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink John 655 Throughout the life of the Church there has been little doubt about the Real Presence If we turn to the teaching of the early Church Fathers we see their clear understanding of this teaching In addition to those cited on our bulletin cover St Cyril of Jerusalem teaches this clearly in his catechetical teachings to those entering the Church Do not regard the bread and wine as simply that for they are according to the Master's declaration the body and blood of Christ Even though the senses suggest to you the other let faith make you firm May we rejoice in this greatest of Sacraments given over to us through the hands of the Lord Himself The Holy Eucharist Serving as the source and summit of our Faith may we recognize He who has given Himself to us and call all others to encounter Him through our words and deeds In the words of St Maximilian Kolbe When you kneel before an altar do it in such a way that others may be able to recognize that you know before whom you kneel At this time of year many of our college students are beginning to return to their campuses for the starting school year Many of those who have graduated high school or college earlier this summer have also now begun to enter the workforce or are devoting themselves to military service I encourage all of our parishioners to pray for these students and recent graduates The challenges our youth face are not small and we must do everything we can to keep them connected to the Lord and His Church May we each pray one Our Father and one Hail Mary every day for those of our parish as they begin a new school year or are venturing beyond high school or college We may not fully grasp how powerful such prayer can be but it will be revealed to us in the Kingdom So pray and trust We must all recommit ourselves to the children in our parish religious education program starting in September This ministry is one that needs the support of our entire parish and exists for one basic purpose To help families form disciples of Jesus We can support this ministry both by volunteering as catechists and aides contact the Parish Office to volunteer and by striving to serve as witnesses through our own lived discipleship This means both being attentive to our prayer life and availing ourselves faithfully to the Sacraments The Stained Glass of St Joseph This Thursday August 22nd at 6:30PM we will host a two part series looking at the stained glass windows in the Church The windows on the two sides of the Church each tell a story The south side windows walk us through the life of Christ The north side windows through the life of the Saints and symbols of the Catholic Faith This Thursday we will look first at the life of Christ and walk through the windows on the south side of the Church Our windows themselves date back to the late 1970searly 1980s They were installed several at a time having been made by City Glass of Fort Wayne The intricate jeweled designs were created by an artistic collaboration between Mr Robert Berg a designer from City Glass and a committee of parishioners from our parish Each window is breathtakingly beautiful both in its imagery itself and in the amount of scriptural detail contained within St Francis Summer Reading Program Our St Francis Summer Reading Program has come to a close If there are still any books to be returned please return them to the Return Box that will be at the base of the St Francis statue in the narthex starting next weekend Next weekend we will also announce our top three readers who will have a choice of prizes to choose from Faithfully in Christ Fr David <a
