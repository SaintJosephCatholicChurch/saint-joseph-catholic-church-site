  "text": "SEVENTH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME February 23 2020 Entering into the 7th Sunday in Ordinary Time we have but a few days left to complete our personal preparations for the most sacred Lenten season Our Lord challenges us in our readings this weekend with what it means to be His disciples Lent calls us into forty days of prayer fasting and almsgiving so that we might die to ourselves and be better prepared to respond to these challenges of discipleship As St Augustine says Fasting and almsgiving are the two wings of prayer which enable it to gain momentum and more easily reach even to God As we enter into this season of fasting our lives are meant to mirror the Churchs liturgy During Lent the liturgy itself is stripped bare There are no flowers surrounding the altar the Priest wears violet vestments to reflect this penitential and mournful season our candlesticks and altar crucifix turn to wood to draw our minds to the noble simplicity of Lent unbleached wax candles are used with the candlesticks as the somber tones of unbleached wax harmonize with the mournful tone of this season and starting on Ash Wednesday neither the Gloria nor the Alleluia will pass from our lips again until the Easter Vigil Again we keep this solemn fast The front of the bulletin offers a few of our weekly opportunities to make use of throughout the Lenten season Soup Suppers Stations of the Cross daily Mass times and regular times for the Sacrament of Reconciliation We will also offer a variety of other opportunities for prayer charity and fraternity including Showing The Passion of the Christ a Novena to St Joseph our Lenten Food Drive the Parish Mission March 30th April 1st the Palm Sunday Procession and the Holy Week Liturgies And as a reminder St Joseph is also open at all hours to serve as a place for prayer On Ash Wednesday February 26th the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and distribution of ashes will be offered at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM Note Incense will be used at the 7 PM Mass In the narthex the parish will make available the Little Black Books our yearly Lenten devotional and a parishcreated weekly Lenten Guide offering suggested activities and challenges for each week of Lent There will also be a box in the narthex throughout Lent to collect nonperishable food donations for the Wells County Food Bank As a reminder both Ash Wednesday Feb 26th and Good Friday April 10th are to be observed as days of prayer and fasting On these two days we not only abstain from meat but limit ourselves to one normal and two small meals throughout the day Throughout the remainder of Lent we also abstain from meat on all Fridays The biblical practices of fasting Matthew 914 15 and abstinence Daniel 1023 serve to strengthen our selfdiscipline and remind us that we live not for the comforts of this world but for life in the heavenly kingdom This holy season calls us to tread the way of penance and to mortify our flesh Romans 813 so that we through the mercy of God may see our Lord in the glory of His victory over death How we will live this Lenten season will be different for each of us as we live it out according to our state of life Yet in living it out however we are able we walk with our Lord May this Lenten season be one that is both challenging and filled with Gods abundant grace Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday February 22
