  "text": "WENTY IRST UNDAY I RDINARY IME UGUST 22 2021 This weekend August 21st 22nd the Church celebrates the Twentyfirst Sunday in Ordinary Time Hearing the conclusion of the Bread of Life Discourse from the sixth chapter of St Johns Gospel we hear how many turned away from the Lord and in doing so returned to their former way of life John 666 Though the crowds had followed Him a great distance in the end only the Twelve remained This response of those following after Jesus parallels Israels cry against God and Moses upon first entering the desert Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt Numbers 143 Israel was prepared to turn away from the Lord their God and return to the slavery that He had just delivered them from Why would they turn away Because journey that was ahead was very challenging just as Jesus teachings seemed hard John 660 This was not however the end of Israels story just as it is not the end for those who follow after Jesus As we hear in our first reading Israel had returned to the Lord and after forty years in the desert entered the promised land Coming forth from the harsh desert Israel renews their conviction proclaiming We also will serve the LORD for he is our God Jos 2418 When we encounter Jesus we are called to conversion This path is hard It is challenging Yet like Israel in the desert it leads to the promised land Heaven Are we prepared to follow Jesus even along the challenging path IRECTOR OF ACRED USIC AND ITURGY Over the past many months we continued the search for our new choir director We have had many wonderful
