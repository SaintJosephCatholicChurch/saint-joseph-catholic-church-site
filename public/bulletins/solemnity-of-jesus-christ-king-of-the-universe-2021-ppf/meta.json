  "text": "UR ORD JESUS HRIST ING OF THE NIVERSE OVEMBER 21 2021 Join us for a special morning Mass on Thanksgiving Day this Thursday Nov 25th at 9 AM Come and begin this day of thanks in the Eucharist This weekend November 20th 21st the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe This celebration was only recently added to our liturgical calendar by Pope Pius XI in 1925 Seeing the horrific aftermath of the First World War Pius XI instituted this feast to call the whole world to turn to Jesus the Prince of Peace and King of the Universe RESBYTERAL OUNCIL As you may have seen in the Todays Catholic I was recently elected to our diocesan Presbyteral Council Several have asked what this council is and what this appointment means To find the answers to these questions we simply have to look to our own Parish Council for understanding Our Parish Council consists of several parishioners that serve as a representation of our parish The council offers advice and guidance to the pastor regarding the direction of the parish On the diocesanlevel the Presbyteral Council serves the same purpose for the diocese and the Bishop as the priestmembers serve as representatives of our various parishes Members are either voted onto the council by the priests of the diocese or appointed by the Bishop We will meet several times a year to offer Bishop Rhoades advice and guidance regarding the direction of the diocese Similar to a parish council each member of the Presbyteral Council serves a three year term These appointments do not affect our parish assignments IOCESAN ITURGICAL UIDELINES As we prepare for Advent our diocesan liturgical guideline have remained the same Locally our county did have a week of being yellow this month before returning to an orange rating regarding coronavirus transmission rates For the time being we will continue to follow the several precautionary measures that we do still have in place at the parish Most of our remaining precautionary measures are prudential practices that allow for the option of greater physical distancing and other precautions for those who have need to make use of them We will continue to make hand sanitizer and face coverings available for use in the narthex and the back of Church We will also continue to have several rows roped apart that allow for greater physical distancing in the front of the Church Liturgically we will continue with the suspension of the distribution of the Most Precious Blood the ordinary use of Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion and announcing the exchange for the Sign of Peace at our weekend liturgies In addition those distributing Holy Communion will continue to make use of hand sanitizer prior to distribution and the wearing of a face covering for weekend liturgies These general practices allows those who are at an increasedrisk for illness the option if appropriate for them to join us inperson for Mass while also allowing limited physical contact with others and keeping an appropriate physical distance as we gather together in worship As always thank you for your patience and understanding as we try our best to follow our diocesan guidelines as best suited for our parish family I do hope that we will soon return to taking up the collection and bring forward the gifts at Offertory To do this however we will need additional volunteers for our Ushers Ministry If willing to volunteer for this ministry please see the signup sheet in the Narthex Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday November 20
