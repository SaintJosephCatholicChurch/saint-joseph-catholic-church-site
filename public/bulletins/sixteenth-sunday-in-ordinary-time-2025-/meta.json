Time July 20 2025 This weekend July 19th 20th the Church celebrates the Sixteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time We continue our journey through the Gospel of St Luke where last Sunday we heard that to inherit eternal life we have to love God with all our heart being strength and mind and to love our neighbor as ourselves The Parable of the Good Samaritan offered a powerful example of what loving our neighbor as ourselves truly means Today as Jesus visits the home of Martha and Mary we receive Jesus teaching on loving God Though Martha welcomed the Lord to her home her attention was elsewhere Mary on the other hand is sitting at His feet as a devoted disciple listening Jesus gently corrects Martha reminding her that Mary had chosen the better part Centering her day first around Him rather than trying to fit Him in after the busyness of the day has died down The correction shown to Martha is one that we should use within our own lives May we put Jesus at the center of our lives even amidst the busyness of the everyday For when we build our lives around Jesus in prayer and the Eucharist we can begin to live even now the life of heaven that will one day please God be fulfilled forever Our Lord will continue this theme of loving God next weekend focusing specifically on prayer Luke 111 13 After five months of bulletin covers highlighting the lives of the Saints we're trying out a new default bulletin cover for the summer months This new cover combines both old and new elements from our parish in this anniversary year At the top our new parish logo is highlighted Central to the cover is a drawing of St Joseph and the Christ child that first appeared on our bulletin covers in the 1980s The practice of preserving older bulletins was fairly common in the mid to late twentieth century especially when our bulletins were published through a publishing house At the end of each year the publishing house would send the parish a bound collection of the past year's bulletins Depending on what these annuals might contain you may see a few other throwback images on the bulletin covers for a bit of variety When the need arises we will still make use of the bulletin cover for both educational material and promotion of events As such covers have been prepared through our parish office however they require more time and effort to create Having a default cover helps to ensure that we ll always have a bulletin cover ready for print and help to make our bulletin look more familiar and easily identifiable Totus Tuus Weekday Mass Schedule Change Please note our weekday Mass schedule will be fairly different this week to better accommodate the Totus Tuus Summer Youth Program Daily Mass will be offered Monday through Friday at 11:15AM this week Adoration will
