  "text": "THIRD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME January 26 2020 Next Sunday the Church will celebrate the solemn Feast of the Presentation of the Lord This feast falls the fortieth day after Christmas Day and commemorates St Lukes account of our Blessed Mother and St Joseph presenting Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem forty days after his birth Luke 22138 As the Holy Family is following the prescripts of Leviticus 1214 this day is also traditionally known as the Purification of the Blessed Mother For this reason St Luke records the event as taking place when the days for Her purification were complete Luke 222 Finally it is also traditionally known as Candlemas This emphasizes the prophesy of St Simeon in the Temple when he was moved by the Holy Spirit and recognized the Christ Child as a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel Luke 23032 Liturgically the Feast of the Presentation mirrors Palm Sunday Both of these days recalls our Lords entrance into Jerusalem first as a child to be presented by His parents and then by His own power as an adult to accomplish His Paschal Mystery Both liturgies gives us the opportunity to begin our celebrations with a blessing one of candles and the other of palms followed by a solemn procession into the Mass Next weekend we will offer a blessing of candles immediately prior to each weekend Mass We will bless the candles that we use throughout the year including those used for the Blessing of Throats You are invited to bring any candles that you want to have blessed for use in your home Please see this weeks bulletin insert to learn more about Candlemas and the use of candles in liturgy and prayer special Thank You to Fr Jacob Meyer and St Monicas in Mishawaka for creating this insert Blessing of Throats At all Masses next weekend we will offer the Blessing of Throats in anticipation of the Feast Day of St Blaise on Monday February 3rd St Blaise is a 4th Century martyr having been beheaded for the Faith in 316 AD He was a physician before becoming a priest and was eventually named the bishop of Sebaste modern day Armenia Visiting those imprisoned and encouraging the faithful during a time of persecution St Blaise was eventually arrested himself subject to much torture while imprisoned St Blaise refused to renounce the Faith and many miracles are attributed to his intercession most notably the healing of a young boy who was choking on a fish bone For this reason St Blaise is the patron saint of those suffering from illnesses of the throat Near his feast day a special blessing is offered asking him to intercede before our Lord to protect us from all illnesses of the throat Winter Weather Reminder When considering inclement weather please remember that our weekend Masses will always be offered as scheduled at St Josephs Saturday Vigil Mass 5 PM Sunday Masses 7:30AM and 10 AM As disciples of the Lord we have an obligation to keep holy the Lords Day and when we are physically able to
