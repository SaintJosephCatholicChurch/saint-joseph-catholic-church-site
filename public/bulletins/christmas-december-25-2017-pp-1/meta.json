  "text": "POINSETTIA THE MEXICAN Flower of the Holy Night Dr Joel Poinsett was US ambassador to Mexico in the early 1800s In 1829 when he returned home he brought with him a plant that the Mexi can people called flower of the Holy Night We call it the poinsettia after Dr Poinsett and use it as a favorite Christmas plant It has a fable origin Long ago on Christmas Eve a poor child made his way to Church in great sadness because he had no gift to offer the Christ child Not daring to enter the church he knelt humbly on the ground outside and prayed tearfully telling the Lord of his great desire to offer a gift Unwilling to approach with empty hands he finally rose only to behold springing up at his feet a plant with dazzling red spectacular blooms This was the answer to his prayers These blossoms he took to the feet of the Christ child Since then the flower of the Holy Night has spread through the whole country blooming each year at Christmas with such glorious aban don that the very sight of it fills believers with the spirit of this season of the Saviors birth The Catholic Source Book Nativity Scenes According to tradition Francis of Assisi be gan the practice of using mangers at Christ mas time Sometimes called the Saint of the Incarnation Francis believed that of all the ways God has revealed his love none is more total and tangible than the Incarnation of his Son So it isnt surprising that for the mid night Mass Christmas 1223 in a cave in Greccio Italy Francis presented a living re enactment of the nativity scene This visual and creative and apparently first commemoration of Christs birth has now become traditional Creche is a French word meaning manger or crib The Catholic Source Book The Three Nativity Gifts Matthew 211 Gold for the royalty of Jesus Frankincense for the divinity of Jesus Myrrh for the Passion of death of Jesus The Three Wise Men who came to seek and honor the infant Jesus were Gaspar Balthasar and Melchior 8th Grade Confirmation

what you have make the best of it and help with those who have it bad time for family to come together and celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ time to celebrate with friends and family also celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ Christmas is not all about gifts its about family Some think its all about what they get and not giving to someone in need of food and money Dont give people sass or rudenesssay thanks and appreciate that they got something for you Some people dont get things for Christmas they just stay with family And just remember its all about family and Jesus being born So be thankful on Christmas and give instead of being greedy of getting Your Friend Alex Mechling Grade 4 What Christmas Means to Me By Emma Roembke Grade 6 To me Christmas means Jesus birth It means celebrating all He has given us all that He has done for us and all that He thinks about us It means spending time with family and practicing our family traditions The older I get the more thankful for Christmas I become As my siblings start their own lives and move away the less I am able to see them Christmas brings all of us together in celebration most years Beyond the family celebrations I connect with God more and more as each Christmas comes My faith in His everlasting loves strengthens and grows I feel God all around me but especially during Christmas time To me Christmas means the love of God and family Oriana Makowski Grade 12 Some people say that they cant wait till Christ mas because of all the presents Well let me just tell you that Christmas is NOT about the pre sents If Jesus was never on this earth then we wouldnt have Christmas at all He opened the gates of heaven and that is the best gift of all To me Christmas is about the family and Jesus is part of that family In my family we treat Christ mas more of a birthday party for Jesus more than how many presents can I get thing To me at Christmas time it makes me happy to give than to get and I like to give a lot more than to get So to mainly wrap it up I think to me Christmas means family and a time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Thank you for reading this Cassie Coyne Grade 5 Gabby Hoffacker Grade 1 says
