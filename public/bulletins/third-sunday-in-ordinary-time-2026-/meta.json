Sunday in Ordinary Time January 25 2026 This weekend January 24th 25th the Church celebrates the Third Sunday in Ordinary Time also known as Word of God Sunday Instituted by Pope Francis I in 2019 this celebration at the very beginning of Ordinary Time is meant to help us grow in religious and intimate familiarity with the Sacred Scriptures Aperuit illis Paragraph 15 By doing so we are able to receive His Word and better allow it to shape our minds and hearts as His disciples In honor of Word of God Sunday our bulletin cover this weekend presents a brief overview of the 73 books of the Bible As we saw in Jimmy Akin's The Bible Is Catholic Book the Bible did not fall from heaven fully formed nor was it assembled by chance It was received preserved and canonized by the Church under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and entrusted to her care The same Holy Spirit who inspired the Scriptures did not abandon the Church once the canon was established Instead He continues even now to guide the Church in faithfully handing on proclaiming and interpreting the Word of God Sacred Scripture never stands alone but lives within the Church through which Christ continues to speak to His people today Diocesan Synod Opening Mass for the Parish Session This Monday January 26th at 6 PM we will host our Opening Prayer Session in preparation for our Parish Synod Session At this Mass we will invite the Holy Spirit to guide our hearts as we begin this synodal journey together as a parish In two weeks on Monday February 9th at 6 PM we will have the opportunity to gather for our Parish Synod Session as our participation in the preparation for the upcoming Diocesan Synod These two sessions are an opportunity for the Faithful of our diocese to prayerfully reflect together on one central question How is our local Church called to live the mission of Christ today and in the years to come Our Parish Synod Session will allow each of us to share our voices prayerful reflections and experiences as a unique and irreplaceable part of our local Church The parish synod will in turn help guide the larger Diocesan Synod At the end of the Parish Synod Session the various insights shared will be compiled and submitted to Bishop Rhoades as a faithful representation of the parish's voice With our contributions and those of the other parishes of our diocese Bishop will set the broader synodal questions for reflection at the Diocesan Synod in November I encourage you to join us for these sessions College students away from the parish are also invited to prayerfully participate in a special college synodal session and share their perspective on faith and life on campus Participants are asked to watch a short video message from Bishop Rhoades pray and reflect on five themes and submit their reflections online by Feb 28th To learn more and participate in the special college session visit diocesefwsborgcollege synod Note Childcare will be provided for the Parish Synod Session on February 9th Votive Candles One of the most common questions received since the start of renovations is whether votive candles are anywhere in the building available for use While we had hoped to make our small votive candle racks available in the Parish Social Hall for weekend Masses space limitations and fire alarm restrictions make this too impractical throughout the renovation period Our votive candles will return once we return to the church proper If you've ever wondered about votive candles they have a storied history in both Scripture and tradition The light of the candle symbolizes God's presence with us manifested in Christ who is the Light of the world When lighting a candle we petition our Lord in prayer asking the Saints to join in prayer both with and for us to the Lord The burning candle remains lit in the Church even after we've gone as a sign of our continuous prayer before God Saturday January 24 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm
