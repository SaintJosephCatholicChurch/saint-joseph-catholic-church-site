at 9 AM with Fr Bill Sullivan serving as our primary celebrant This weekend Aug31 st September 1st the Church celebrates the Twenty second Sunday in Ordinary Time Having spent the past month working our way through the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St John we now return to the Gospel of St Mark for the remainder of the liturgical year Over the next three months we will continue to walk sequentially through this Gospel as we delve deeper into the mystery of Jesus and His identity All four of our readings this weekend focus on God's law In the Gospel Jesus teaches on the nature of God's Law With His Incarnation the Law no longer consists primarily in dos and dont's of external behavior as important as that can be It is now more clearly a rule of the soul a guide for our interior person which is itself reflected in our actions The love of God in our hearts nourished through the Sacraments must overflow into our daily lives Thank you for all those who assisted with our Registration Weekend last weekend special Thank You to Michelle in the Parish Office for her work in arranging our Religious Education Pizza and Sundae Bar If you have not registered yet for our Religious Education Classes 12th Grade there's still time to do so Please contact the Parish Office for more information before classes begin next weekend Classes are Sundays from 830 9:45AM Parish Parking Lot Earlier this week our parking lot was sealed and re striped by locally based Liby's Stripe Right This yearly maintenance helps to ensure the upkeep of our parking lot for years to come and is made possible by your generous support of the monthly Building Rainy Day Fund special Thank You to Rick Singer for his help in organizing this project I'm sure that we can all agree that the black sealcoat and gold striping makes the parking lot look fantastic Walking Through of the Mass Bulletin Covers Having just walked through the Bread of Life Discourse we have had a eucharistic focus this past month Starting this weekend our focus turns at least on our bulletin covers to the structures of the Mass We do not simply approach reception of Holy Communion in a void but are prayerfully prepared for this reception through the liturgy The liturgy itself can in many ways be compared to our own Walk to Emmaus Luke 2413 35 Our hearts are enflamed by hearing from the Word of God the Sacred Scriptures before the breaking of the bread In the breaking of the bread we are then called to recognize the very Word of God Himself Jesus Christ whom we receive in the Holy Eucharist Our liturgical celebration as seen on our bulletin cover beautifully unfolds in four main parts The heart of our worship consists in the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist These two parts are so interconnected they form a single act of worship the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ the Mass Surrounding these central parts are the Introductory Rites and Concluding Rites The first prepares us to fully engage in Mass and the latter to joyfully be sent forth to make disciples of all nations Matthew 2819 20 We will spend the remainder of the liturgical year breaking apart these four parts of our liturgical celebration Doing so will help us to grasp the true beauty and poetry that is present in this pinnacle of true worship The Sacrifice of the Mass Catholicism Explained Thursday Sept
