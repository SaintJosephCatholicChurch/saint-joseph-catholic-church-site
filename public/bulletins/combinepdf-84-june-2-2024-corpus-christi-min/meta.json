10 AM Mass on Sunday make sure to join us for our Corpus Christi procession as we honor our Eucharistic Lord through the streets of our community This weekend June 1st 2nd the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Corpus Christi Since AD 1246 this solemnity always fell on the Thursday after the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity This use of Thursday for the celebration was meant to unite our focus with the celebration of the Last Supper on Holy Thursday Throughout the United States however this celebration has now been transferred to the nearest Sunday to allow for greater participation This celebration honors our timeless belief in the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist This truth has stood as the cornerstone of our Faith since it was proclaimed by Our Lord Himself in the Bread of Life Discourse John 6 Described as the very source and summit of our Faith Catechism Paragraphs 1324 1327 the reality of the Eucharist is beyond words In the Eucharist is contained the whole spiritual good of the Church Christ Himself The earliest Christian attest to this truth In AD 110St Ignatius of Antioch a disciple of St John the Apostle hands on this truth that which he himself received from the mouth of the Apostle Those who were outside of the Church abstained from the Eucharist and from prayer because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ flesh which suffered for our sins and which that Father in his goodness raised up again In AD 151St Justin Martyr explaining the Faith to the Roman Emperor states As we have been taught the food which has been made into the Eucharist by the Eucharistic prayer set down by him is both the flesh and the blood of the incarnated Jesus Tertullian of Carthage often called the Father of Western Theology explains in AD 210 that our flesh feeds in the Eucharist on the body and blood of Christ In AD 227St Augustine of Hippo teaching the newly baptized states That bread which you see on the altar having been sanctified by the word of God is the body of Christ What is in that chalice having been sanctified by the word of God is the blood of Christ Similarly to those entering the Church in AD 350St Cyril of Jerusalem questions who would dare to doubt any longer that the Eucharist is Jesus Body since He Himself has declared it Century after century the teaching is the same The Eucharist is the Body Blood Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ It is no mere sign or symbol but a true reality His Real Presence given to us by the very same Lord Himself Our solemnity today celebrates this reality one that should fill our hearts with gratitude as we are in the presence of the Lord Himself For this reason we go into the streets today as well so that all may have a chance to encounter Him For those participating in the Corpus Christi procession you may notice several unique practices canopy will walk in procession over the Blessed Sacrament both practically protecting the Blessed Sacrament from adverse weather and spiritually creating a visible sacred space where our Lord is exalted in His Eucharistic glory Along the journey we will have several stational stops Each stop will be accompanied by a Scripture reading and prayer These stations remind us that this procession is meant to mirror our life Moving from destination to another as we seek to follow after the Lord who is leading the way Daily Mass As our schedules shift into summer mode and become a bit more flexible it is always good to remember that we do offer daily Masses Tuesdays through Saturdays Daily Mass on Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays are at 8:00AM on Wednesdays at 7:00PM and Fridays at 8:30AM In the words of St Padre Pio assisting at Mass produces in our souls marvelous effects abundant spiritual and material graces which we ourselves do not know PARISH CALENDAR Sat June 1 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sun June 2 Mass 7:30am Mass 10:00am Sun June 2 Corpus Christi ProcessionIce Cream Social
