  "text": "Seventh Sunday of Easter Ascension Sunday May 29 2022 This weekend our nation observes Memorial Day On this day we thank God and pray for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our country's freedom Join us for Mass this Memorial Day Monday May 30th at 9 AM This weekend the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Ascension This celebration is meant to mark the fortieth day since Easter Sunday and points us toward Pentecost Though our Lord Jesus has ascended to the right hand of the Father He has not abandoned us On Pentecost the Lord sends forth the Holy Spirit to renew the face of the earth vivify His Church and remain ever with us For our Parish Family and Mass in the Summer Each weekend one of our repeated Mass intentions is offered for our Parish Family This summer however you will notice that this intention will generally not be listed among our weekend intentions That is because as I travel for the summer this intention travels with me This intention is formally known as the Pro Populo Mass or the Mass for the People As pastor of St Joseph I have the responsibility under Church law Canon 534 1 to offer a Mass for the people of our parish every Sunday and Holy Day of Obligation As the Catechism states the Mass is the highest form of prayer that we can offer Catechism Para 1324 How appropriate it is then that the pastor frequently offers the Mass on behalf of those entrusted to his care Though I will be away from the parish for the summer I remain the pastor of our parish and I retain this great responsibility to offer Mass on your behalf This means that every Sunday wherever I might be I will offer the Pro Populo Mass for our parish family As priests are also strongly encouraged to and I personally believe should offer Mass everyday I will offer my weekday Masses throughout this summer for many special intentions that I have been asked by others to pray for Entering into the summer months it is important to remember that our attendance at Sunday Mass remains just as important during this time as at any other time throughout the year If you are traveling any weekend this summer you can find Mass times at <a href=\"www.Masstimes.org\">www.Masstimes.org</a> for churches throughout the world Ensuring that we attend Mass most especially when traveling on vacation serves as a beautiful witness to how important the Mass is It also allows us to experience the universality of the Church seeing our Faith lived in various places Visiting Priests and Summer Coverage As I leave this week for the Catholic University of America in Washington DC we will welcome a number of priests to assist with Masses over the next three weekends For daily Masses priests from Decatur Fort Wayne will be providing coverage each day On Saturday June 4th we will welcome Msgr Michael Heintz Academic Dean of Mt St Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg MD for our Vigil Mass On Sunday June 5th Fr Stephen Felicichia parochial vicar at St Elizabeth Ann Seton will preside at our morning Masses The following week end we will welcome Fr Bill Sullivan as the presider for our weekend Masses On June 18th we will welcome Fr John Sheehan SJ who will be in residence at the rectory for the remainder of the summer Fr Sheehan a priest of the Society of Jesus or Jesuits currently serves as the chaplain at the University of St Francis in Fort Wayne Prior to this he has had a wealth of experience serving as a missionary for 12 years in Nigeria 27 months in the South Pacific and most recently three years in Amman Jordan Before entering the Jesuits he worked in professional theatre and broadcasting As always I thank you for the warm welcome you will give to our visiting priests throughout the summer Over the next two months I will be fairly focused on my studies especially with the approaching oral comprehensive exam at the end of the summer This means that I will not be regularly checking my office voicemail or parish email during the summer If you need to reach me please contact the Parish Office Let us always keep each other in prayer and I look forward to being back at St Joseph's in August Our Bulletin
