Meyer Ron Payne David Carr Ronnie Bonnie Burns Michael Green Dorothy Dottie Marbach and Rick Cotterman Holy Family of Jesus Mary and Joseph One of the most beautiful miracles that I am privileged to witness is when a couple turns into a family on the occasion of the birth of their first child or when they adopt their first children Those who are married but do not yet have children are families too Im not saying they arent but I think those of you who do have children know exactly what Im talking about Childbirth or adoption changes both the husband and the wife and consequently their relationship more profoundly than just about any other event in their entire marriage You are now not just husband and wife but also father and mother and this transition to parenthood produces in you virtues that no one knew you had and draws on instincts that surprise even you as a couple I had never thought of my sisters as especially courageous until I saw each of them the day they gave birth And I definitely never thought of my brothers as especially patient until I observed them calmly reasoning with their children regarding their behavior When they became parents those famous parental instincts kicked in big time and changed them forever Today is the feast of the Holy Family On Christmas Mary and Joseph became a family in the full sense of the term and like many of you the arrival of this child changed them profoundly They were now not just husband and wife but also foster father and mother and this transition produced in them virtues that we see throughout the story of Jesus infancy and childhood We see Marys courage in riding a very uncomfortable donkey to Bethlehem while nine months pregnant and Josephs pa tient futile attempt to find lodging and finally their faithfilled humble acceptance of an unsanitary barn in which to give birth to their child At this point they become parents which changed them more than even the remark able events of Marys pregnancy and produced in them the virtues and parental in stincts that they would need to protect Jesus from harm and raise him as God would want And it is a good thing that this change kicked in right away because they soon faced crises far more difficult than the usual grind of sleepless nights and dirty dia pers and far harder to understand Some of these events were pleasant but strange poor shepherds visit at midnight babble on about angels and then drop to their knees to worship the infant how strange Rich foreigners arrive after a long journey talk about a star and offer gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh what to make of this And in todays Gospel odd prophecies about this childs remarkable destiny spoken in the Temple by Simeon and Anna But other crises they soon faced were not only strange but also lifethreatening and eerily resembled what had happened 1200 years earlier to Moses murderous king killed baby boys in an attempt to eliminate Jesus the new Moses but like Pharaoh let the girls live Warned in a dream just like another Joseph 1700 years earlier Jesus father fled with his family to the safety of Egypt where they lived as refugees And when the time was right they left Egypt in a new exodus and made their home in Naz areth Joseph and Marys trust in Gods providence enabled them to know what to do in their times of crisis They walked by faith More beautiful than the miracle of a couple turning into a family at the arrival of their first child is the even greater miracle of a worldly family turning into a holy family as they learn to walk by faith We feel so responsible and want to control everything want everything to be just so But if that is where we place our trust were in for a rude awakening thats how the worldly live and besides you cant know what the future will hold Mary and Joseph show us a better way do the best you can and then trust God to do the rest recognize that hes the one in control not us Jesus Mary and Joseph are not the only holy family They are the holiest family ever but they are not the only family to walk by faith trusting God and eager to do his will in all things This is how you and I are called live as well So does this describe your family is your family truly a holy family too Todays feast of the Holy Family should be our family feast as well Bishop Anthony Taylor preached the following homily in Ponca City Okla On
