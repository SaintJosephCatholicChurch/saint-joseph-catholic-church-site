  "text": "Third Sunday of Lent March 12 2023 This weekend March 11th 12th the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Lent This Sunday has two names both Scrutiny Sunday and Oculi Sunday Scrutiny Sunday the more ancient of the two names acknowledges that on this weekend the first of the three the Scrutinies is observed In the Scrutinies those preparing to enter the Church on the Easter Vigil are called forward and prayed over by our community to prepare for the celebration and initiation soon to come This name itself dates to at least the 6th Century Oculi Sunday comes from the first word of today's Entrance Antiphon or Introit taken from Psalm 25 My eyes are always on the Lord for he rescues my feet from the snare Turn to me and have mercy on me for I am alone and poor This desire expressed by the Psalmist is now meant to become the desire of both the Catechumen preparing to enter Christ's Church and the Faithful seeking to grow closer to Christ In Christ we find the He who rescues us from our misery and is the fullness of our hope St Patricks Day and Bishop Rhoades Decree Please see the special insert in this weekend's bulletin from Bishop Rhoades regarding the celebration of St Patrick's Day this coming Friday March 17th and our Lenten practice of Friday abstinence from meat This decree known in Church law as a singular administrative decree in itself offers us the opportunity for a beautiful reflection on the interplay that is often found between Sacred Scripture Sacred Tradition and the Magisterium The concept of fasting and abstinence are that have strong biblical roots in both the Old and New Testaments cf Matthew 914 15 Daniel 102 3 As we heard on the First Sunday of Lent our Lord Himself underwent forty days of fasting in the desert Though the Lord Himself fasted and speaks of the fasting of His disciples cf Matthew 616 18 He did not impose a manner of fasting upon the world by an express commandment Though our Lord makes clear that we should fast He does not state how we are to do so As such we now turn to Sacred Tradition and the Magisterium to guide our practices The practice of fasting is well described by the Early Church Fathers Pope St Clement I writing near the end of the 1st Century emphasized how fasting allows for growth in virtue Tertullian writing near the end of the 2nd Century extols fasting as a means of strengthening self discipline As this spiritual practice has been modeled by Christ and extolled and handed down by the Fathers throughout the centuries how it is expressly observed has been left to the guidance of the Church The Magisterium or the teaching office of the Church regulates this practice throughout the centuries at the behest of the Lord cf Matthew 1619 As the Church regulates the practice She then also has the ability to dispense or in our situation commute the practice for a just cause Bishop Rhoades in his decree is exercising his share of the Church's teaching office for the spiritual good of those placed under his care or all of us For further reading on this I would recommend Pope St Paul VI's Apostolic Constitution Paenitemini 1966 and our National Bishops Conference letter Pastoral Statement on Penance and Abstinence 1966 Both documents are readily searchable online and are very informative reads especially during Lent Lenten Retreat Day Set Apart At the advice of our Parish Council we will be offering a day long Lenten Retreat at Church on Saturday March 25th from 9 AM to 2 PM This retreat will take the place of our annual Lenten Parish Mission
