REJOICE IN THE LORD AND LIVE LIFE OF FAITH FELOWSHIP AND LOVE My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all These adages are always true with respect to some situations Birds of the same feather flock together birds of a feather flock together Tell me with whom you go and I will tell you the kindtype of person you are Flocking together gives them protection You cannot break a bundle of broom all together a once But if you take the brooms one by one you break each of them We need one another in Fellowship NOT FOLLOWSHIP Listen to this story Once upon a time a hen took her chicks out for feeding All of a sudden a terrible thunder storm stared with a horrible wind and heavy rain fall The hen quickly asked her chicks to come up to high land and spread her wings and the chicks put their heads under the mothers wings After the rain she led them home safely Within few days the mother hen fell sick and died The chicks became hungry after staying for few days without enough food They decided to go out and feed themselves So they went out As they were feeding suddenly a terrible thunderstorm stared with a horrible wind and heavy rain fall The checks were in trouble and frightened One of them said let us hurry home Another said no the flood will carry us away Come up to a high land They hurried up to the high land The leader raised its right wing and asked one of them to put her head under his wing and then closed it and asked his sister chick to raise her wing and her bother chick puts his head So they continue to do forming a circle until the last of ninth chicks raised his wing and the leader put his head By so doing they protected one another and survived the adverse weather We are call to do likewise for one another We are our brothers and sisters keeper That is the fellowship we need to practice In the 1st Reading Acts 24247 We saw the fellowship the communal life of the early Christians of Jerusalem It is called koinonia which means fellowship commun ion brotherhood This is an important element in our Christian way of life Christians of all ages They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and communal life to the breaking of bread and prayers All who believed were together and had all things in common Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple area They ate their meals with exaltation and sincerity of heart praising God and enjoying favor with all the peoples We need to emulate them by practicing Christian values of love justice tempered with mercy mutual respect decency read the Bible in our family Members should carry one another have concern for each other such fellowship keeps faith alive For those who love God everything works onto good The absence of Thomas when the Lord came became a bless to us In the Gospel Jn 201931 The doors and windows where the apostles were were locked for the fear of the Jews The Lord with His glori fied body stood in their mist and said Peace be with you Thomas was not present week later He came again and Thomas was there He confronted Thomas for his con tinuing doubt Put your finger here and see my hands and bring your hand and put it into my side and do not be unbelieving but believe Thomas exclaimed My Lord and my God Thomas was the first of the apostles to call Jesus God That is great The Lord then said Have you come to believe because you have seen me Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed That is you all of us Let us rejoice in the Lord for He has risen God bless you Msgr Pius
