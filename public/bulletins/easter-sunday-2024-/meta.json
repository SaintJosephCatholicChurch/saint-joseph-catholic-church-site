Alleluia Alleluia Whether this is your first time visiting with us or if you are a life long parishioner we rejoice to celebrate Easter with you Thank you for joining us as we celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ We no longer fear death for the death of our Savior has set us free For this reason Easter is not just an event that is to be remembered but a reality to be lived everyday of our lives With the reality of Easter our Easter Sunday celebrations continue for the rest of the week in the Easter Octave This joy cannot be contained in a single day Instead the joy of Christ's Resurrection echoes anew each day The full Easter Season or Eastertide lasts for fifty days These fifty days of Easter joy should be lived just as intensely as we lived out the past forty days of preparatory prayer fasting and almsgiving during Lent Congratulations to our three Elect Fabiola Heather and Liam our six Candidates for Full Communion Ben Brandon Gene Judy Patti and Stacy and our two young men who made their First Holy Communion Martin and Alfredo this Easter weekend We rejoice together as a parish family as our family continues to grow special Thank You to their godparents and sponsors and to Jill our RCIA Coordinator for their diligent work throughout the year to help prepare all those received Though we have entered into the Easter season our Catholicism Explained class will continue for two more weeks During this time those who have entered into the Church enter into a period known as mystagogy This practice traced back to at least the fourth century and St Cyril of Jerusalem invites those who have just received the Sacraments at Easter to reflect on the life changing graces that they have received This period of mystagogy is one useful for each of us to consider How often we may not fully grasp the beauty of the Sacraments that our Lord continues to provide for us through His Church These outward signs of inward grace have been given to us by the Lord Himself to help us grow in our relationship with Him The Easter season is a wonderful time to reflect on these gifts of grace and to ask the Lord to use them in renewing our lives and strengthening our hearts throughout this earthly journey towards the Resurrection special Thank You also to all those who helped make our celebrations so special Our Choir and Youth Schola both under the direction of our choir director Teresa helped to elevate our hearts and minds to the Lord not only in Holy Week but throughout the entirety of the Lenten season Our servers under the direction of our Master of Ceremonies Dan helped to guide our liturgies and our prayer Our Decorating Committee have enhanced the beauty of our church building for our Easter celebrations And our Parish Staff Michelle Teresa and Stacey helped keep things moving behind the scenes Easter Gift Rosaries from the Holy Land As you are sent forth from our Easter celebrations please take with you a Rosary from the Holy Land as a gift from our parish These rosaries made of olive wood from Bethlehem serve as a reminder that the resurrection is no mere story but a reality God became man Jesus walked this earth and is risen from the dead Many of these rosaries obtained during a past pilgrimage to the Holy Land have themselves been laid on the empty tomb of Jesus Easter Egg Hunt Next Sunday April 7th we celebrate the Octave Day of Easter known as Divine Mercy Sunday Our Easter celebrations are not meant to be celebrated in solitude but together as a community Join us next Sunday after the 10 AM Mass for our
