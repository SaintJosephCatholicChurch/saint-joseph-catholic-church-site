  "text": "Pentecost Sunday May 28 2023 Join us for a special Mass this Memorial Day Monday May 29th at 8:00AM with Fr Stephen Felicichia serving as our principal celebrant and homilist This weekend May 27th 28th the Church celebrates the great Solemnity of Pentecost Marking fifty days since Easter Sunday this day is considered to be the second most important feast of the liturgical year and always falls on Sunday Sunday is a day already made holy by the creation of light and the Resurrection of Jesus At Pentecost Sunday is about to receive its final consecration and bring us the fullness of God through the reception of the Holy Spirit In the Old Testament God foreshadowed the glory that was to belong at a future period to this fiftieth day during Israel's exodus from Egypt Having passed through the Red Sea Israel wandered in the desert for seven weeks before arriving at Mount Sinai It is here as described in Exodus 19 24 that Israel enters into a covenant with God and are now called His chosen people This is known to us now as the Mosaic Covenant On the fiftieth day in the desert this covenant between God and His people is marked by the reception of the Torah and of the Ten Commandments Every following year the Israelites celebrated this great event by a solemn festival known as Shavuoth or Pentecost fifty days after Passover This Festival of Harvest Exodus 2316 is a joyous celebration marked by the bringing of the firstfruits of the harvest to the Temple in thanksgiving to God That which was foreshadowed has now been fulfilled in Jesus Christ as we receive the firstfruits of the Holy Spirit Romans 823 How different these two Pentecosts One on the rugged rocks of Mt Sinai amidst thunder and lightning promulgates a Law that is written on tablets of stone the second is in Jerusalem where the Spirit of love the Holy Spirit is about to descend from heaven and fulfill the merciful design of our Redeemer Jesus Christ on the hearts of man Ezekiel 3626 27 The Holy Spirit descends upon the Apostles as tongues of fire Acts 23 cf Exodus 1918 He brings from Heaven both the tongue that is to teach and the fire the love of God and of mankind which is to give warmth and efficacy to this teaching The tongue and the fire are now given to these first disciples who by the assistance of the Holy Spirit will transmit them to others through the Church And so will it continue until the end of time Having received the gifts of the Holy Spirit at Baptism and Confirmation we too have received the firstfruits of the Holy Spirit Galatians 522 23 The Holy Spirit encourages us to be active members of the Body of Christ and to help bring the fire of Christ's love to enlighten and unite this dark and divided world St Francis Summer Reading Program Sign ups are
