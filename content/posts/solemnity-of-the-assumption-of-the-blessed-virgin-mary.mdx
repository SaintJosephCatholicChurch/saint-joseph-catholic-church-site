<p>On Sunday, August 15th, the Church will celebrate the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This solemnity is yearly observed as a holy day of obligation. As this celebration, however, falls on Sunday, the Assumption will take the place of the Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time. Our Sunday Mass schedule for the holy day will remain the same (Saturday Vigil Mass - 5 PM; Sunday Masses - 7:30 AM &amp; 10 AM).</p>
