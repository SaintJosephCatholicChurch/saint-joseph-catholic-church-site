  "text": "OURTH UNDAY OF DVENT ECEMBER 20 2020 Entering this Fourth Week of Advent our Christmas celebrations draw near Over the next few days the Church will begin to be decorated replacing the simplicity of Advent with the great and exuberant joy of the Christmas season Just as we walked the four weeks of Advent to reach Bethlehem our Christmas celebration will continue beyond just Christmas Day culminating on the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord January 10th Preparing for Christmas we will offer extra times for Confession this Monday and Tuesday from 500600 PM For Christmas itself weve increased the number of Masses between Christmas Eve and Day from three to five Our wellattended Family Mass on Christmas Eve will be offered at both 4:00PM and 6:00PM to allow for social distancing Overflow seating will be available in the Parish Social Hall for all Masses As mentioned last weekend Pope Francis has recently declared it the Year of St Joseph This celebration of the Patron of the Universal Church and our own parish patron will continue until next year on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception Dec 8th 2021 As a part of this celebration our Holy Father has granted plenary indulgences available throughout the duration of this special year By committing ourselves to prayer and good works we are able to perpetuate the entrustment of the whole Church to the powerful patronage of the Custodian of Jesus Included in this weeks bulletin is a handout that offers the conditions for the aforementioned plenary indulgence As we know a plenary indulgence is the remission granted by the Church of all the temporal punishment due to our sins Through these acts of prayer and charity we are called out of ourselves and are challenged to deepen our relationship with the Lord preparing our hearts right now so that we might be ready to meet Him at the hour of our death The reverseside of the handout offers an exegesis of our Gospel reading Luke 12638 in relation to the Blessed Virgin Mary With a focus on the greeting of the Archangel St Gabriel we gain a better understanding of Marys role in salvation history the Churchs teaching of the Immaculate Conception and Mary as the new Eve As St Irenaeus of Lyon wrote in the late2nd Century The knot of Eves disobedience was loosed by the obedience of Mary What the virgin Eve had bound in unbelief the Virgin Mary loosed through faith In the coming weeks our St Joseph Womens Group will be hosting a raffle which will award several cash prizes The proceeds raised from the raffle will be put towards cleaning and refurbishing our baptismal font ensuring its proper upkeep for years to come As has been done with past raffles each parish family will be sent raffle tickets If so inclined we invite you to participate in the raffle or if you know others who might be interested to invite them to participate For your planning purposes our January Discussion Forum will be a Teaching Mass offered at our normal times Sunday Jan 10th from 8:30AM 9:30AM and Wednesday Jan 13th from 7:30PM 8:30PM Please note a Teaching Mass is not a Mass Instead it is a walk through of the Mass that looks at the various prayers items and traditions found throughout our liturgy Given the nature of the discussion this forum will take place in the Church not the Parish Social Hall All are welcome Faithfully in Christ Fr
