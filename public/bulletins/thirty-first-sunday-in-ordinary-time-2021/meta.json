  "text": "HIRTY IRST UNDAY I RDINARY IME CTOBER 31 2021 As a reminder Daylight Savings Time ends next Sunday November 7th Dont forget to turn your clocks back one hour for next Sunday This weekend October 30th31st the Church celebrates the Thirtyfirst Sunday in Ordinary Time As we near the end of the liturgical year our readings continue to focus on the cost of discipleship and living out our Faith This focus will culminate in three weekends in the celebration of the Solemnity of Jesus Christ the King of the Universe Our liturgical year begins anew each year in anticipation of the coming Jesus Christ as Advent prepares us for Christmas And it ends each year with a recognition of Jesus Christ as the King of the Universe All things begin and end in Jesus Christ Our path of discipleship isnt simply a path we walk to grow in virtue though we should but a path that is meant to help us grow in our relationship with Jesus Christ the source of all virtue Our bulletin cover highlights the Catholic roots of Halloween which leads us into All Saints Day and All Souls Day Though its roots are found in our tradition not everything about how Halloween is currently celebrated is good for the soul We should avoid the use even jokingly of Ouija boards tarot cards and such things which attempt to communicate with spirits or participate in occult practices Though these practices may seem harmless to some they are spiritually harmful and can even be sinful Through them we are seeking out a power other than that of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Instead of turning to these occult practices we are always to turn to our Lord and to His Saints If anyone has any such occult items that they wish to remove from their homes please reach out to me I will help you to properly dispose of them What can we do instead of such things We turn to the Lord and His Saints in prayer This can include reciting the prayer of St Michael the Archangel and asking the intercession of St Joseph the Terror of Demons and our patron I would encourage you to turn to such prayers not only when at Church but also to be praying them together at home as a family LL AINTS AY LL OULS AY AND EMETERY LESSING This Monday November 1st is the Solemnity of All Saints As this day falls on a Monday though a holy day it is not a holy day of obligation this year This means that we are not obliged to assist at Mass on this day Though it is not a holy day of obligation may we see it as a holy day of opportunity We will have three separate opportunities to assist at Mass on Monday 7 AM Noon 5:30PM and will have our annual All Saints Day Celebration after the evening Mass Come dressed as your favorite Saint This Tuesday November 2nd is the Commemoration of All Souls On this day we gather to pray for all of our loved ones who have died and help them on their path to heaven We will again have three opportunities to assist at Mass on Tuesday 8 AM Noon 7 PM as we pray for our dearly departed loved ones Before the 7 PM Mass on All Souls Day you are invited to join us on Tuesday November 2nd at 6 PM for the blessing St Joseph Catholic Cemetery 3500 IN124 Bluffton east of Elm Grove Cemetery
