  "text": "WENTY IRST UNDAY IN RDINARY IME August 23 2020 This weekend August 22nd23rd the Church enters into the 21st Sunday in Ordinary Time And as with the past three weekends our Gospel reading Matthew 161320 is preparing us to enter into the fourth great discourse of St Matthews Gospel The Discourse on the Church In this preparation Jesus has been speaking to His disciples about the establishment of His Church which as we hear today is built upon St Peter When our Blessed Lord wished to establish His Church He came from heaven and when about to return to heaven He appointed St Peter to take His place upon earth and rule the Church as directed Therefore our blessed Lord though not on earth is still the real head and owner of His Church and whatever His agent or vicar that is our Holy Father the pope does in the Church he does it with the authority of our blessed Lord Himself He serves as the steward or the one who holds anothers place and acts in his name of the Church here on earth As attested in both our Gospel and first reading Isaiah 221923 the bibli cal concept of a steward is seen in the imagery of keys The key of the House of David is given to Eliakim and the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven are given to St Peter For this reason St Peter is often depicted in some manner with keys This is seen in our stained glass window of St Peter on the north wall of the church St Peter holds two keys and at his feet are two keys with the pa pal tiara a sign of the papacy For this reason we see the image of two keys in the Vatican flag now hung opposite the American flag outside of the rectory Serving as the official flag of Vatican City it depicts the papal tiara above crossed gold and silver keys The gold key represents spiritual power and the silver worldly power red cord connects the two keys alluding to the bond between the two powers Changes to our Parish Music Program short while ago the pastor of St Paul of the Cross in Columbia City and I spoke regarding our shared music ministry As many know Sr Rose Ehrlich CSA has served as the shared choir director between both our parish and St Paul of the Cross for the past two decades After speaking we both agreed that our parishes are currently in positions to move forward with each parish having their own dedicated Choir Director After speaking with Sr Rose the three of us sat down together at St Paul of the Cross Following our discussion Sr Rose will be ending her time at our parishes at the end of this month We thank Sr Rose for her years of dedi cated service to our parish and pray for her during this time of transition and change Regarding the future of our music ministry we are working with our dioce san human resource department to prepare a job description for the new posi tion Once finalized we will open the search nationally for all interested and qualified applicants Please also keep this coming search for our parish in your prayers Parish News and Updates This coming Monday I
