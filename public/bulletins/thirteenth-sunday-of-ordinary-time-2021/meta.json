fiftyfifth anniversary of the dedication of our churchbuilding To mark this celebration our bulletin features a retrocover This cover designed by parishioner Nancy Wagner served as one of our primary bulletin covers during the 1980s This celebration reminds us both of our past and our future It is our story the vibrant epic of the way in which the life of God is nourished in our souls It begins in the churchbuilding as the expectant mother prays for a blessing upon her newly conceived child It ends in the churchbuilding as the mourning family gathers to pray for their departed loved one During all the years in between filled with work and rest joy and sorrow pleasure and pain we gather together to pray as one in the churchbuilding ULY AILY ASS CHEDULE This week I received my class

weekend he will have the opportunity to share with us the good work that his community is doing including evangelization in parish missions providing education through local schools creating local publications and founding various rehabilitation centers throughout North India and East Africa These good works could not continue without our prayers and our financial support With the adverse

Vincentian priests in Fr Joses own congregation Our financial support of Fr Joses mission will not only aide the good work that the Vincentians have been doing over the past many years but will also be put towards relief work for those families suffering from the coronavirus in North India special second collection basket will be set aside our normal offertory basket when entering the Church next
