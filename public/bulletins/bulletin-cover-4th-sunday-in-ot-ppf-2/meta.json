  "text": "OURTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME ANUARY 31 2021 This weekend January 30th 31st the Church enters into the Fourth Sunday of Ordinary Time With this weekend we are now just under three weeks away from Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent Our bulletin cover over the next few weeks will be focusing on Lent as we prepare for these coming forty days of prayer fasting and almsgiving As these penitential days can often seem to pass by so quickly we do not want to approach them unprepared Now is the time to determine how we will make this the best Lent ever Before Lent however we will have a brief resurgence of Christmas On Tuesday February 2nd the Church will celebrate the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord or Candlemas Forty days after Christmas Day Jesus is presented at the Temple by the Blessed Virgin and St Joseph in accordance with the prescripts of the law Leviticus 1214 As St Simeon recognizes the Christ Child as a light to the world Luke 232 this feast day has perpetually been associated with the blessing of candles At our 8:00am daily Mass this Tuesday Feb 2nd we will bless the candles that are used in the church throughout the liturgical year You are invited to bring any candles that you would like blessed for use in your homes to this Mass as well With the coming celebration of Candlemas our Christmas decorations will come down this weekend to mark the last possible end of the Christmas season Though the Christmas season may have ended the joy of the Incarnation remains alive in our hearts Following the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord and the blessing of candles the Church celebrates the Feast of St Blaise Feb 3rd St Blaise the 4th Century Bishop of Sebaste modernday Armenia and Martyr is the patron saint of those suffering from all illnesses of the throat Believed to be a physician before becoming a priest and bishop St Blaise was imprisoned for the Faith Even in the face of torture and martyrdom St Blaise refused to renounce the Faith Many miracles are attributed to his intercession including the healing of a young boy choking on a fish bone On and near the Feast of St Blaise a special blessing is offered that asks St Blaise to intercede before our Lord asking Him to protect us from all illnesses of the throat and all other illnesses This blessing will be offered at all Masses next weekend Feb 6th 7th Following the guidance of our Diocese this blessing will be offered over the entire congregation at the end of each Mass After each Mass those who would desire to and feel comfortable doing so are welcome to come forward and receive an individual blessing as done in past years Similar to our practice for the distribution of Holy Communion please follow our social distancing guidelines if approaching for an individual blessing As we approach Ash Wednesday please note that there will be a change regarding how we distribute ashes this year Following directions from the Vatican ashes will be sprinkled upon the heads of the faithful instead of being imposed directly upon the forehead The sprinkling of ashes upon the head is the common way that ashes are imposed throughout the world to begin Lent The imposition of ashes with the thumb on the forehead is an American tradition which due to the pandemic weve been asked to forgo by the Vatican to avoid unnecessary physical contact Faithfully in Christ
