Knights of Columbus Council 7555 who dedicated this past Saturday morning to weeding and laying new gravel along the Rosary Path Their combined efforts saw the placement of twenty tons of fresh gravel along the Rosary Path and an additional five tons of river rock spread around the campus to assist with drainage around the Church buildings Special thanks to Brother Knights Dan Sudhoff and Rick Singer for spearheading delivery of the gravel and Brother Knight Joe Felger for lending and operating a skid loader to move the gravel In addition to new gravel the benches along the path have also been spruced up special Thank You to Scott Harris of Ossian for cleaning and repainting the benches The Rosary Path and Grotto continues to offer a relaxing and prayerful place for quiet meditation and reflection surrounded by the beauty of Gods creation What better way to reflect on the mysteries of the life of Christ than as contained in the mysteries of the Rosary Rosaries are available in the wooden box at the entry of the path for your use With this beautiful latesummerearlyfall weather I invite and encourage you to make use of the Rosary Path in the coming weeks With the sealing and striping of the southern portion of the lot by Libys Stripe Rite the major construction for our Parking Lot Project has come to comple tion Responding to initial feedback from multiple parishioners we will be having four parking spots restriped to add four additional handicap parking spots in our lot This will help to ensure easy entry to both the Church and Parish Office by all who come here and will be completed in the coming weeks special Thank You again to our various committees that have helped see this project through and for your financial generosity especially to our Rainy Day Building Fund in bringing it to completion In the coming weeks we also hope to see two additional projects brought to completion Electric Company Inc has the parts on order for the exterior lighting improvements around the campus and once the parts arrive they will be installed Come this winter these improvements will ensure that our parking lot will be well lit for our early morning and evening Mass crowds We are also working with Stylus Technologies regarding our hearing assistance system in the Church The system is also on order and is scheduled to be installed by the end of the month On the weekend of Oct 12th 13th we will be welcoming the team from the Catholic Leadership Institute for the Next Generation Parish program They will be here throughout the entire weekend and are open to meeting and speaking with any and all parishioners about our parish They hope to gain an insight into the many good things going on here at St Josephs and offer us some insight into the Next Generation program This program seeks to help form intentional disciples to assist in the spreading of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the New Evangelization to use Pope St John Paul IIs term Let us pray for this chance to grow deeper in our relationship with Jesus Christ together as a parish In conjunction with this prayer let us also continue to pray for our Holy Father Pope Francis and all of our Bishops throughout the world as they continue to guide the Church through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit prayer written spe cifically to ask the Holy Spirit to continue to inspire our Bishops in their continued efforts in leading the new evangelization is available on the table in the narthex In praying daily for our shepherds we pray for the good of the Church the Body of Christ Let us never take for granted the power of prayer 1 John 514 Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF SEPTEMBER 2122 2019 CANTORS 500 Nichole Decker 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Larry Leitz LECTORS 500
