11823 Sun Sept 9 TwentyThird Sunday in Ordinary Time Is 3547a Jas 215 Mk 73137 22nd Sunday in Ordinary Time September 2 2018 Year Having completed the Bread of Life Discourse from the sixth chapter of St Johns Gospel which is the center of our three year cycle of readings we now return to St Marks Gospel In a sense we have heard from our Lord about that food which He has given us His very Body and Blood that is to nourish and change us into His Body And now in St Marks Gospel we hear how our hearts united to the Lords Sacred Heart must guide us In hearing the word of God in the Scriptures and in receiving the Word of God Himself in the Eucharist we are called to action and service As St James says we must become doers of the word in our lives putting our love of Christ daily into action In our first reading Deuteronomy 412 68 Moses nearing the end of his life is offering his final words and exhorta tions to Israel Reminding them of all they have experienced throughout the exo dus he calls them to continued faithful observance of the Law and obedience to God Entering into a covenant with God Israel is no longer a wandering people Instead they are Gods chosen people and are prepared to enter into the promised land Moses reminds them that their faithful to the Lord and His Law is what separates Israel from all other nations Yet their faithfulness is not to simply be observance of the Law but integrating the Law into their hearts To become Gods chosen people means to enter fully into a personal relationship with Him St James continues this exhortation now given to the Christian commu nity in our second reading James 11718 2122 27 Faithful observance of the Law and obedience to God is found in our personal relationship with Jesus Christ who is the Son of God Mark 146162 and the fulfillment of the Law Matthew 517 We are challenged to not only hear the Word of God but to become doers of the word Our relationship with Jesus Christ cannot be separated from any aspect of our lives whether it be our personal work or casual relationships In stead it must permeate our very being Similar to Israel then we are called to become doers of the word not out of obedience but out of love Our love of Jesus Christ must become the source of our every thought and action In our Gospel Mark 718 1415 2123 Jesus finds Himself at odds with the Pharisees and scribes the teachers of the Jewish people In the Pharisees and scribes we find men who strictly enforce the laws of the Torah Many of these laws though not specifically contained within the Torah arose out of Jewish tradition The Pharisees and scribes begin to question Jesus regarding these as pects of law and tradition It has become apparent from their observations of Je sus disciples that they have not been instructed to follow every minutiae of the laws and traditions as taught by the Pharisees and scribes In this way they at tempt to undermine Jesus teaching authority Jesus in response quickly rebukes them Jesus reminds the Pharisees and scribes that though they may follow the laws and traditions that they themselves have passed down this does not mean they are following the Lord Referencing Isaiah who spoke to Israel when she had greatly strayed from the Lord Jesus reminds the crowd that observe to the laws and traditions are meaningless if they are empty actions Our actions and our hearts must move as one As Moses reminded Israel the laws and traditions do serve a purpose They have been passed down as guides to lead us closer to the Lord in our personal relationship with Him But they can only bring us so far guide becomes useless if we lose sight of both the end and why we fol lowing the guide to begin with The Pharisees and scribes had become so caught up with the external practices specifically regarding purity they forgot that these actions were to aid in the internal actions regarding purity of heart Jesus reminds the crowds that like St James says we are to be doers of the word That is in hearing the Word of God we respond both in action and in heart This will allow the Word of God Jesus Christ to change our very lives In Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF
