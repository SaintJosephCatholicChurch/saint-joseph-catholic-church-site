Time September 22 2024 This weekend September 21st 22nd the Church celebrates the Twenty fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings help us to explore the theme of the suffering of the righteous We are called to discard our usual standards for judging success in this world and adopt a radically supernatural outlook on life When we look through the eyes of Christ we often see that which the world considers as valuable is truly nothing more than mere straw In our commitment to follow after the Lord we may never achieve any true position of authority or recognition in this world But what we gain in return is much more valuable than anything else God Himself We are invited today to make ourselves like the children of the earth the unnoticed the weak the innocent the marginalized because it is in them that God reveals Himself present in a unique way We welcome Deacon Bruce Goodwin at all of our Masses this weekend Dcn Bruce is a son of our parish having grown up in Bluffton and was ordained as a permanent deacon several years ago for the Archdiocese of Atlanta where he now lives He and his wife Jean are in town to visit with family and enjoy our Street Fair festivities When a deacon assists at Mass he is often vested in a dalmatic which similar to the priest's chasuble is a long tunic like vestment Configured through Holy Orders to Christ the Servant the deacon stands next to and assists the priest throughout the liturgy This ministry is focused in a special way on proclaiming the Gospel and serving at the altar As a part of proclaiming the Gospel the deacon carries in the Book of the Gospels proclaims the Gospel reading and at times is invited to preach the homily In addition he also proclaims the Prayers of the Faithful inviting us to turn toward the Lord in our need In service at the altar the deacon prepares the altar during the Offertory and assists in the distribution of Holy Communion particularly the distribution of the Precious Blood when it is offered Finally after the priest has imparted the closing blessing the deacon offers the dismissal as we are sent out like Christ the Servant to minister to and be with those in need Introductory Rites The Gloria Having acknowledged our sinfulness before the Lord we join in a prayerful cry that echoes throughout the Scriptures Lord have mercy This ancient litany is the whole Body of Christ calling out to Christ the Head It is each of us together with the entire Church imploring the mercy of Almighty God so that we may be made ready and worthy to enter into the mystery of the Sacrifice of Christ made present on the altar Our sinfulness reminds us of how much we need to be saved We in turn are called to focus our gaze on Christ who is the channel of God's infinite love and mercy From here recognizing our Savior Himself our lips move from cries of Lord have mercy to a hymn of praise The Gloria This hymn affectionately known as the song of the angels joins our voices with those of the heavenly choir of angels crying out in joy at Jesus birth The Gloria is the perfect response of the solemn confession of one's sins and pleading for salvation to the uplifting and joyous gratitude for the gift of salvation Himself Jesus Christ The hymn itself incorporates verses from Scripture words spoken by angels spirits the apostles and ancient patriarchs like Melchizedek We echo these words perfected through the worship of those that have gone before us The words of the Gloria reflect the various dispositions we take on as we participate in Mass 1 Praise of God We worship you we praise you 2 Thanksgiving We give you thanks for your glory 3 Atonement of sins You take away the sins of the world have mercy on us 4 Petition Receive our prayer In the Gloria let us focus on these aspects of the prayer as we join with choirs of angels in singing Glory to God in the highest Weekend of September 28th and 29th 500 Dan Lautzenheiser 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 David Smith 500 Michelle Paxton
