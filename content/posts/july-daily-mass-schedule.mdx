<p>Due to Fr. David&rsquo;s summer class schedule through the Catholic University of America (CUA), we will need to make changes to our daily Mass schedule for July.</p>
<p>In the month of July, daily Mass on <strong>Thursday, July 1st, will be at 5:30 PM</strong> and on <strong>Friday, July 2nd, at 12:30 PM</strong>.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the month (<em><strong>July 5th-30th</strong></em>), daily Mass on <strong>Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday will be at 5:30 PM</strong>. Our <strong>Wednesday (7:00 PM)</strong> and <strong>Saturday (8:00 AM)</strong> times will remain the same.</p>
<p>Thank you for your flexibility and understanding.</p>
