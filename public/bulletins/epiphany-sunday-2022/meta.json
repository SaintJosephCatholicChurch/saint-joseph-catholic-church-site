  "text": "PIPHANY OF THE ORD ANJARY 2 2022 Happy New Year For much of modern history in using the Gregorian calendar we would refer to this year as 2022 AD AD stands for Anno Domini which is Latin for In the Year of the Lord May we ask for Gods blessings upon this new year And in doing so may we commit ourselves to cooperate with His grace as we strive to continue growing as His disciples May this new year truly be through our lives a year dedicated to the Lord What will such a year look like When making New Years resolutions we can consider adding a spiritual resolution this year This could include spending more time reading the Sacred Scriptures each day perhaps using Fr Michael Schmitzs The Bible in a Year or committing ourselves to greater daily prayer time Other ideas could include praying the Rosary daily especially together as a family going to confession monthly attending a weekday Mass or spending time in adoration As we celebrate the New Year this weekend January 1st 2nd the Church also celebrates the Solemnity of the Epiphany Though this celebration marks the 12th Day of Christmas January 6th on our liturgical calendar in the United States we celebrate it on the nearest Sunday so that we might more readily enter into this Mystery This Mystery itself celebrates the three manifestations of Jesus Christ to the world The Adoration of the Magi the Baptism of the Lord and the Wedding Feast at Cana Focusing on the Adoration of the Magi our Gospel reading Matthew 2112 highlights that the first people to encounter the infant Jesus are the Magi coming from the east The three Magi bring with them the prayers of the whole human race With this account Saint Matthew indicates that God had intended for the Gospel to go beyond its Jewish roots and be spread throughout the entire world Jesus is the Lord and Savior of all Jew and Gentile rich and poor those who are near and those who are far When you leave today please take home with you the Epiphany Chalk As described in the included instructions and on the front of the bulletin this chalk is to be used to bless and rededicate our homes to the Lord in this New Year May it serve as a constant spiritual witness bringing forth much grace to all who enter and dwell in our homes this year In addition to the witness given through our use of the Epiphany Chalk you are also invited to take the name of a Saint from the basket in the back of the Church Each slip of paper includes the name and basic information of a different Saint This custom of picking a Saints name for the New Year comes from a practice at the convent of St Faustina Kowalska We are then challenged to seek out and come to know this older brother or sister in the Faith better throughout the year HURCH FFERING NVELOPES Starting this month you will notice a change in the monthly Church Offering Envelopes that you receive Working with Our Sunday Visitor weve reduced the number of special collection envelopes that are included each month On certain weekends it wasnt atypical to have 4 5 envelopes for the collection basket Mo ving forward special collections will be spaced out further apart Those special collections that are taken up on behalf of the Diocese and support causes outside of our local community may no longer have a physical envelope In such instances we will instead tithe a portion of our weekend collection to support these special causes as they arise As always thank you for your stewardship of our parish and the Church MASS INTENTIONS Saturday January 1 Solemnity of Mary Mother of God 8:00am Jerri
