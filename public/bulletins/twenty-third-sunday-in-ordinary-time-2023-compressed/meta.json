  "text": "Twenty Third Sunday in Ordinary Time September 10 2023 This weekend September 9th 10th the Church celebrates the Twenty third Sunday in Ordinary Time Having spent the past six weekends working through the fourth narrative of St Matthew's Gospel we are now prepared to enter into his fourth great discourse The fourth discourse of St Matthew's Gospel is often referred to as the discourse on Church Order and Practice focusing on how the community of the faithful are to live This focus emphasizes the great importance that was found in the preceding narrative regarding Church authority As we have seen Peter and the Apostles have been set as the leaders of the earthly Church in Greek And amongst these leaders Peter is elevated by our Lord to serve as the Vicar of the Church holding the same power and authority of other vicars of the Davidic kings of Judah Isaiah 2220 24 38th Annual Bishop's Appeal In the coming weeks you will be receiving a mailing from the diocese to announce the start of our 38th Annual Bishop's Appeal This yearly fundraising campaign helps to meet the physical and spiritual needs of the Diocese of Fort Wayne South Bend funding roughly half the central diocesan operation budget Our appeal goal this year is 3724371 All donations above this parish goal will be returned to our parish As with past years our focus this year will be on obtaining 100 of parish participation To participate in this annual appeal all you need to do is return the pledge card you will receive in the mail It can be returned in the mail or be filled out online or dropped in our weekly collection basket Even if you are not in a position to donate financially this year please still return your pledge card This will not only help us move towards 100 participation but will save the parish costs in regards to required follow up mailings As mentioned anything raised over our set goal will be returned to our parish This year we will be putting any overage towards our parish renovation This renovation will include such discussions as painting in the nave and sanctuary updating flooring to replace our well worn carpet and needed repair work and re staining of our pews Though mentioned a number of times throughout the past many years we are finally nearing a point for our planning and discussion phase to start as many of our other parish projects are brought to completion The Triumph of the Holy Cross On Thursday September 14th the Church celebrates the Exaltation of the Holy Cross This feast marks two important events in the life of the Church the dedication of the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher and the finding of the true Cross by St Helen in the fourth century The original basilica was built and dedicated in AD 335 before being damaged by local wars in the seventh century It was rebuilt and rededicated on this day in AD 1149 Tradition has long held that this basilica marks not only the burial tomb of the Lord but also Mount Calvary and the anointing stone where the Lord's body was prepared for burial It was at the base of Mount Calvary itself contained now within the basilica where St Helena mother of the Emperor Constantine was said to have found the relic of the True Cross in AD 320 It is said she found its location with the assistance of St Macarius the Bishop of Jerusalem and many local Christians This day is also called the Triumph of the Cross Elevation of the Cross Holy Cross Day Holy Rood Day or Roodmas Heard in the first reading when Moses lifted up the bronze serpent over the people it foreshadowed the salvation to come through Jesus when He was lifted up on the Cross To follow Christ we must take up His cross follow Him and become obedient until death even if it means death on the cross We identify with Christ on the Cross and become co redeemers sharing in His cross by our daily death to self It is for this reason that we so often make the Sign of the Cross so frequently in our own prayer life to keep on our minds the Holy Cross on which hung the salvation of the world Saturday September 9 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am Confession 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Parish Family
