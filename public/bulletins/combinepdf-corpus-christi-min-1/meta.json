  "text": "The Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ Corpus Christi June 19 2022 special Welcome to Fr John Sheehan SJ as the celebrant of our weekend Masses Fr John will be in residence at St Joseph's for the remainder of the summer Join Fr John on Thursday June 23rd at 7 PM in the Parish Social Hall for a chance to ask him questions and learn more about him Thank you for the warm welcome that I know you will show him Happy Father's Day To all of the fathers in our parish including all fathers grandfathers priests godfathers uncles and all other men who often serve as fathers in important ways within extended family parish communities or individuals lives Happy Father's Day Thank you for your witness to the Father's love This weekend June 18th19th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ or the Solemnity of Corpus Christi Continuing with last weekend's theme of unity from the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity we see how we are now called into the triune love of God As we have been united to the Body of Christ through the Sacrament of Baptism we are continually nourished as members of this body through reception of the Most Holy Eucharist These concepts of unity and nourishment are described by Ven Fulton Sheen as such The Eucharist is food for our soul but the power of assimi lation here belongs to Christ and it is He Who feeding us unites us and incorporates us with His life It is not Christ Who is changed into us as is the food we eat it is we who are incorporated in Him With John the Baptist we say He must become more and more I must become less and less The moment of communion is that special intimacy reserved to real lovers There are three intimacies in life hearing speaking and touching Our first contact with anyone who loves us is to hear his voice our second is to see him the third and this is reserved only for intimates is the privilege of touch We hear of Christ in the Scriptures we see Him by the eyes of faith but we touch Him in the Eucharist He only asks that we should purge our consciences of sin and come to Him ready to receive what He wants to give us for He knows that we need Him excerpt from These Are the Sacraments 1962 by Ven Fulton Sheen Continuing with our Eucharistic theme our bulletin cover this weekend retells the account of the Eucharistic miracle in Bolsena Italy This miracle along with the 13th Century mystical visions of St Juliana of Lige helped to bring about the Solemnity of Corpus Christi as it is celebrated today We will continue highlighting Eucharistic miracles on our bulletin cover throughout July highlighting the Eucharistic Revival we are entering into as a parish diocese and nation The miracles that we are highlighting were compiled by Bl Carlo Acutis Bl Carlo was a 15 year old youth and amateur computer programmer who enjoyed documenting Eucharistic miracles from around the world on his website <a href=\"www.miracolieucaristici.org\">www.miracolieucaristici.org</a> before passing away from leukemia in 2006 On October 10 2020 he was recognized as blessed one step away from being formally recognized as a Saint after a miracle in Brazil was attributed to his intercession Pope Francis has called Bl Carlo a model of holiness in the digital age He compared Bl Carlo's use of the computer to the efforts of the first disciples who traveled on foot to bring the Good News of Christ to people Bl Carlo was so moved by the Eucharist that he used his computer skills to help bring these miracles to the world in an accessible way To try and share the hope that he found to a world seeking out hope Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday June 18 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm
