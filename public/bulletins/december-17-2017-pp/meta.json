2017 YR WE ARE INVITED TO FIND JOY IN OUR SAVIOR THUS REJOICE AND PRAY My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all Today is Gaudete Sunday Why Gaudete Sunday It is so called because from tradition the 3rd Sunday of Advent is called Gaudete Sunday for it was taken from the first word of the antiphon of the Introit Entrance hymn Rejoice Cf Phil 445 It is so called also because we have gone half way in our preparation and anticipation of the coming of our savior Jesus Christ So we need to rejoice for our salvation is close at hand From December 17 we enter the second part of the Advent We are invited to pre pare more directly for the Lords birth We can now use Come Come Em manuel more extensively The Christmas Tree can be blessed We will bless ours on December 24 Sunday Remember that we have done our Advent Penance Ser vice ReconciliationConfessions last Monday December 11 2017 If you did not come or you still need Confession come on Tuesday December 19th by 8:30am Thus In the 1st Reading Is 6112a 1011 Isaiah the prophet assured us that the Lord the Savior of the world the liberator the Anointed One of God is coming to lib erate us to set prisoners of sin free We rejoice in God for he has clothed us with the garment of salvation This prophecy was made to the Israelites who came back from exile from Babylon They rejoiced coming back to their land We in our own part we rejoice for coming back and closer to God through intensive preparation and confess ing our sin And so we need to rejoice The 2nd Reading 1 Thes 51624 also called us to rejoice to be happy and pray always We should pray always giving thanks to God Why should we pray always Yes we need to pray always because prayer is life What water is to the life of the fish that is what prayer is to our spiritual life What air is to human life is what prayer is to your spiritual life You know now why you must pray always How can you pray al ways You can pray always by offering everything you do to God Then pray at least in the morning and in the evening Then all through the day call God to help you in every thing you do any time Try to live in the presence of God More details on this will be some other time So rejoice and be happy for your deliverance is close at hand Then in the Gospel Jn 168 1928 John the Baptist was baptizing the people with water and was testifying that he was not the Christ We notice the unselfishness of John and his humility He is a great preacher but bears witness to Christ If he had claimed that he was the Christ many people if not all the people would have believed him But he just spoke the truth Let us learn to speak the truth always He was a voice crying out in the wilderness saying Prepare the way for the Lord and make straight his paths I hope that we are doing something about what John the Baptist said You know that one of the greatest contributions of Christianity is that it brought joy to the world The joy of Christmas the joy of service the joy of loving one another the joy of helping those in needs All these Christianity taught us and brought to the world It is wonderful We must do something to contribute our quota in bringing joy to ourselves individually to our Family to our community and to the entire world and especially to all around us God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it Third Sunday of Advent Joy Rejoice in the Lord always I shall say it again Rejoice Philippians 44 The amount needed each week to make budget is 511640 We are 155760 ahead of budget
