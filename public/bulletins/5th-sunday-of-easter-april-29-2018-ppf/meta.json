brothers and sisters in Christ the Lord be with you I want to still congratu late those young boys and girls who were confirmed this April and those who are making their First Holy Communion next Sunday May the graces of these Sacra ments strengthen you Thanks to the Catechist teachers who prepared them thanks to their parents sponsors and all who helped them Last weekend we reflected on the Good Shepherd For we need to allow God and the Lord Jesus to lead us When we allow the Lord to lead us we will be able to avoid meaningless existence that sometimes threatens and cripples our life In todays Liturgy we need to learn how the early Christians worked together and moved beyond conflicts and thus increased growth in numbers and in faith We need God and we need one another in our journey to eternity We need fellowship and not followship Listen to this When physically strong animals like water buffaloes are together in herds they are said to be harmless But whenever you meet one buffalo alone you are advised to be careful for it might be vicious and attack you Human beings follow a similar rule Alone Loner can be dangerous for we need one an other to be real human beings So let us work together There is need for togetherness belonging to for a Christian who fails to develop relationship with others usually fails to develop relationships with God The Church encourages us to teach our children to relate with one another in the family with friends and on parish level It is when the relationships happen on these levels can someone have a beautiful relationship with God and Christ You know that supernatural builds on the natural Grace builds on nature In the 1st Reading Acts 92631 We read that the Church in Judea Galilee and Samaria was at peace when Saul now known as Paul who tried to destroy the Church became one of the Churchs most effective preacher when he joined and be gan relationship with the apostles Barnabas helped Saul and introduced him to the Apostles Then Paul listened and developed relationship with the Apostles and then developed relationship with God If you remain alone a loner you cannot really love For Love needs the other The 2nd Reading 1 Jn 31824 commands us to love in deed and in truth not just by mere words and speeches but love in action It is the supernatural love Agape love that we are talking about In the Gospel Jn 1518 Jesus expresses the need to be in union with him He said Remain in me as I remain in you Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains in the stem of the tree I am the true vine you are the branches The vine image is used here by the Lord Jesus to show the importance of union togetherness and relationships So we need to live in Christ and allow Christ to live in us There should be an IYou or IThou a person to person relationship between you and another and thus between you and Christ Let us be united and together work out our salvation NB 1 Please mark your calendar June 3 is Eucharistic Procession It starts by 8:30am and ends about 9:05am Lets show our Faith and express our belief in the Real Presence of Our Lord in the Eucharist 2 We will soon tell you the

Did you know Background checks work Background checks in churches schools and other organizations keep predators away from children both because they scare off some predators and because they uncover past actions which should ban an adult from working or volunteering with children If an adult has had difficulty with some boundaries that society sets such as not driving while intoxicated or not disturbing the public peace he or she may have difficulties with other boundaries such as not hurting a child a child Never forget that offenders lie SCRIPTUREMASS READINGS FOR THE WEEK Mon April 30

sufferings it is a sign that He has great plans for you and certainly wants to make you a saint Pray hope and dont worry Worry is useless God is merciful and will hear your prayer Our Lord does not look so much at the greatness of our actions or even at their difficulty as at the love with which we do them Do not try to please everybody Try to please God the angels and the saints they are your public You must ask God to give you power to fight against the sin of pride which is your greatest enemy the root of all that is evil and the failure of all that is good For God resists the proud Oh my God forgive what I have been correct what I am and direct what I will be Christ has made my soul beautiful with the jewels of grace and virtue I belong to Him Whom the Angels serve To sing is to
