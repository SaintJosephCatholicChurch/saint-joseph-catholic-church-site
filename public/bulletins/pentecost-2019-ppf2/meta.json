second great est feast day of the liturgical year the Solemnity of Pentecost It was on this day that the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and the earthly ministry of the Church began Pentecost comes from the Greek word for fiftieth as it falls on the fiftieth day following Easter Sunday This weekend will bring to a conclusion our Easter Sea son and starting Monday return us into Ordinary Time though we will still celebrate two major solemnities on the coming Sundays with Holy Trinity Sunday and Corpus Christi Though we return to Ordinary Time we should not allow ourselves to over look or quickly forget the Solemnity of Pentecost as the liturgical seasons change Instead we must allow this day of great joy to lead us into Ordinary Time Our Lord returned to the Father so that the Father and He could send the Holy Spirit on Pente cost At was at this moment that the Church the mystical Body of Christ began on earth vivified by the Holy Spirit governed by its visible head Peter presided over by one invisible head Christ in heaven And as the Church began here on earth it was sent out on mission We having celebrated together the Easter Season are now likewise sent out on mission Like the Apostles we are filled with the Holy Spirit through Baptism and Confirmation These past fifty days we have been nourished through what we have heard the Holy Scriptures and that which we have received the Holy Eucharist We are now prepared to be led by the Holy Spirit from Pentecost into Ordinary Time Liv ing our liturgical lives we will see this fulfilled as we are sent out as missionaries of Jesus Christ into the ordinary of our daily lives That flame of faith set ablaze at the Easter Vigil and nourished throughout Easter must now be taken into the world The light of Christ which we carry in our hearts must burn brightly and bring light into the darkness that clouds our world Our bulletin cover is a picture of the Sanctification Dome at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington DC As mentioned last week one of the first things I did upon arriving in Washington DC for the sum mer was visit the Basilica our national shrine and pray for our parish family Inside of the Basilica are five domes each highlighting different aspects of Jesus Christ and His Church The Sanctification Dome dedicated in 1968 portrays the Solemnity of Pentecost as it depicts the descent of the Holy Spirit onto the Apostles In this famous Pentecost scene from the Basilica the tongues of flame de scend upon the Apostles and those gathered with them as described in our first read ing Acts 2111 At the corners of the image though it may be difficult to see are displays of various peoples These are people from Africa Asia Europe and America to emphasize the sanctification of every corner of the whole world by the Holy Spirit As the Churchs earthly ministry began she received her mandate from our Lord to spread the good news and was sent out John 2021 This ministry that began 2000 years ago continues even to this day Our Lord continues to send out His Church which includes each and every one of us to proclaim the Gospel message to the whole world How will we preach the Gospel in our lives today Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF JUNE 1516 2019 CANTORS 500 Nichole Decker 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Marita Crawfis

church when the priest was speaking Not all however have read Father Conroys book Mill Town Pastor nor his delightful telling of a similar experience There are two of us preach ing in this church at once said the pastor and I dont know which of us is giving the better sermon When a baby cries in church he is telling two things First that there are babies in the family and second that the mother has come to Mass with her baby On the whole I think the baby is preaching the better sermon and Ill let him go on with it BUS TRIP TO THE SHRINE OF CHRISTS PASSION ST JOHNS INDIANA JUNE 15 2019 Enjoy
