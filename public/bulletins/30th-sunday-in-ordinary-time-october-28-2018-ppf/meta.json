PM on Wednesday October 31 Masses 7 AM and 5:30PM on Thursday November 1 All Souls Day Masses 8 AM 12 PM and 7 PM on Friday November 2 On November 1 we celebrate the Solemnity of All Saints a Holy Day of Ob ligation On this day we rejoice with the Church Triumphant those men and women who have lived lives in imitation of our Lord Jesus Christ and are now united with Him in the Communion of Saints As they have lived lives imitating Christ their lives become models for us as they always point us to Christ And as even death cannot separate us in Jesus Christ Romans 83839 we even now remain united to our broth ers and sisters in the Lord through the Mystical Body of Christ which is the Church United to the Saints through Christ we find in these righteous men and women powerful intercessors on our behalf James 516 Just as we so often turn to our brothers and sisters here on earth in times of need we are also called to turn to our heavenly brothers and sisters We can ask for their intercessory prayer on our behalf to our heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus Christ And as we gather together to worship God through the Holy Mass we are united with this great cloud of witnesses Hebrews 121 in a special way At Mass the entire Body of Christ in heaven and earth unite in one voice of praise to our heavenly Father as we offer the singular sacrifice of His Son Jesus Christ As we join with them now at the Liturgy offered here on earth we hope to one day be united with them and our Lord in the heavenly Liturgy On November 2 we celebrate All Souls Day On this day we the Church Militant here on earth join with the Church Triumphant in heaven in praying for the Church Suffering 2 Maccabees 123946 The Church Suffering are those men and women who have gone before us but due to our imperfect lives have not yet reached the full perfection of life represented in Jesus Christ In Purgatory these men and women are cleansed and purified by the fire of the Holy Spirit as they leave their old self behind and fully put on Christ Ephesians 42224 Having learned the fullness of divine praise through this purification the Church Suffering enters into the Commun ion of Saints and join in the heavenly chorus praising God for all eternity 1 Corin thians 31115 Scriptural Reflection for the 30th Sunday in Ordinary Time In our first reading Jeremiah 3179 the prophet Jeremiah promises Israel that their longstanding exile in Babylon nears an end Though they are still in exile Jeremiah exhorts the people to even know begin their shouts of joy and exultation for the very promise of Gods salvation should bring joy to Israels heart This same hope ful expectation is found in our Gospel today Mark 104652 Bartimaeus upon hear ing that Jesus is passing by calls out to Him Even as those present try to silence him Bartimaeus calls out all the more Bartimaeus who had heard of Jesus knew that his moment for salvation was now before him and nothing would stop him from crying out And Jesus hearing the cries of Bartimaeus calls for him As Jesus heals Bartimaeus we hear it is because of Bartimaeus faith Trusting in the Lord completely Bartimaeus gains new life as his sight is restored And as he follows after the Lord we see that this life is truly based in Christ Having trusted in the Lord before he could even see Him Bartimaeus becomes a disciple one who follows after Christ As Bartimaeus sees now not only with earthly eyes but eyes of faith he becomes an example for us all May we like Bartimaeus turn to the Lord in our blind ness and boldly ask Him for sight to see anew trusting that He will provide Prayer to St Michael the Archangel Saint Michael the Archangel defend us in battle be our protection against the wicked ness and snares of the devil May God rebuke him we humbly pray and do thou Prince of the Heavenly Host by the power of God cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who wander throughout the world seeking the ruin of souls Amen In
