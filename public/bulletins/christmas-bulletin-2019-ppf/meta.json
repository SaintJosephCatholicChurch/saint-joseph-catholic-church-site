family celebrating that message of great joy given to the shepherds in the fields so long ago Today in the city of David a savior has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord This message has continued to spread from age to age and is meant to touch every human heart filling us with faith hope and love Our Christmas joy is so great that it cannot be contained in a single day Christmas is not over but has only just begun Our celebrations continue over the next two weeks as we celebrate the Epiphany of the Lord January 5th and His Baptism January 12th May we open our hearts to welcome the Christ Child throughout this season and allow His peace to reign in our lives ROM ALL OF US HERE AT JOSEPH May the grace and blessing of Christmas be with you May the Christ Child always light your way May Gods holy angels guide you and keep you safe each and every day Faithfully in the love of the Christ Child Fr David As is our parish tradition St Josephs offers a gift to every parish family and all those joining us this weekend as a part of our Christmas and Easter celebrations This Christmas we are gifting Jimmy Akins The Bible is a Catholic Book copies of which are available in the narthex Jimmy Akin is a convert to the Faith and over the past 25 years has become a wellknown author and is also a weekly guest on the global radio program Catholic Answers Live In this quickpaced book he provides wonderful and biblicalbased insights into the inspired and historical development of the Sacred Scriptures Over the past months Ive had many parishioners remark how they desire to have a deeper understanding of the Scriptures These remarks prompted our Advent Bible Study I hope that through this gift each of us can gain a deeper understanding of the Sacred Scriptures and our Church who our Lord Himself has entrusted to safeguard and interpret the Sacred Scriptures Throughout January we will offer a four week book study of The Bible is a Catholic Book starting

very often It allows me to have a greater sense of appreciation for those that love and care for me Above all Christmas serves as a reminder to be appreciative of all the wonderful things that I take for granted in my life Clayton Vachon Grade 12 What do Kindergartners think is important about Christmas Canaan Fosnaugh Christmas presents and being with my family AnnaLynn Felger Presents and giving joy and happiness Santa Claus is the best Annie Herr Special presents Ainsley Wagner Getting presents and seeing people love each other Jackson Felger Wanting a new train and it means to be good What Christmas means to me Christmas means to me it brings me joy that makes me happy and filled with joy Im happy about my family gathering around and giving presents around and it just gives me joy Cooper Pearson Grade 4 Christmas is the day Jesus was born I like to celebrate his birthday spending time with my family Parker Christal Grade 3 When I was younger and was asked What Christmas means to me I would probably say something like opening gifts and the food Even today there are many people who think of Christmas as candy canes family dinners friends parties and much more but sometimes they overlook the true meaning of Christmas it is the Lords birthday Christmas does not mean you cannot give gifts or believe in Santa Claus and Rudolph By all means you can still have those wonderful traditions what I am saying is that to me Christmas means more than wrapping a pair of warm Christmas socks your grandma gives you or the Mexican apple salad I eat ever year To me Christmas is about a new beginning starting over a new year of a stronger journey in our Catholic Faith What I mean by this is when we go to con fession God forgives our sins and by what I believe is that when God gave us his only begotten son he was giving us a heads up like Okay guys I have given you my only begotten son and when he dies I am giving you the key to heaven You have time to start prepar ing for when he dies to prove to me that you are worthy to have a spot in heaven I believe he is telling us that since he has given us his only son we need to prepare for his arrival not so much as St Nicholas To me Christmas has many meanings for instance family because God gave us his only begotten son Jesus Another one is faith faith to me is believing in something you have never seen I believe that during Christmas we need to keep joyous hopeful and true to our faith in Christ Christmas to me means staying true to our faith and families and having hope of the messiahs birth Jacque line Mayer Grade 7
