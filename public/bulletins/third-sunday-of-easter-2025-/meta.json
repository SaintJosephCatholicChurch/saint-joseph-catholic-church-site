1027 30 Third Sunday of Easter May 4 2025 This weekend May 3rd 4th the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Easter Having moved beyond the Easter Octave the remainder of this wonderful season is known simply as Eastertide During this time we continue to reflect on the joy of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ a joy which spreads forth like the light of the dawning sun banishing the darkness of night This season concludes on Pentecost with the sending forth of the Holy Spirit In addition to our Eastertide celebrations we also are excited to celebrate First Holy Communion at our 10 AM Mass this weekend for our 2nd Graders We are thankful not only for these our children but also for their parents families and our religious education catechists Each has played a vital role in helping to cultivate the love of Christ and a firm belief in His real presence in the Eucharist into the hearts of these children There is nothing that gladdens the heart like seeing a child radiant with joy at receiving our Lord in Holy Communion for the first time May their joy spread like a flame and enkindle our own hearts to recognize the very Lord that they and we receive today in the Most Holy Eucharist This same Lord has given us His very self as nourishment for our earthly journey so that the union we experience with Him now may be enjoyed for all eternity Entering into the month of May our First Holy Communicants will also assist for our annual May Crowning Though devotion to the Blessed Mother is traced back to the very roots of the Church the practice of dedicating the month of May to her is more recent dating back only three hundred years This devotion connected to the six Marian feast days that fall in May was bolstered by several Marian apparitions throughout the 19th Century Described by Pope St John Paul II crowning Mary as queen is done because she was a perfect follower of Christ and is the absolute crown of creation She is the Mother of the Son of God who is the messianic King Scripturally it is from the description of the Blessed Mother from Revelation 12 Practically it reminds us to keep the Blessed Mother as a model of faithful discipleship and central in our lives to help nurture devotion to Jesus One of the ways that we can deepen our devotion to the Blessed Mother throughout this month is by praying the Holy Rosary daily This prayer meditating upon the life of Jesus serves as a powerful weapon in our spiritual lives Pray it everyday either by yourself with your family or with a group In the words of St Josemara Escriv The holy Rosary is a powerful weapon Use it with confidence and you'll be amazed at the results White Smoke The Journey to Electing a New Pope With the conclusion of the Novemdiales this evening our focus now shifts to the papal conclave and the election of a new pope Following last Monday's gathering of the College of Cardinals the conclave is scheduled to begin on Wednesday May 7 Traditionally an initial vote is held on the first day followed by three to four votes each day until a new pope is chosen As always the eyes of the world are on Rome during this historic moment If youre interested in learning more about the conclave and what leads up to the appearance of white smoke and the announcement of Habemus papam join us on Tuesday May 6th at 5:30PM in the Large Meeting Room at the Wells County Public Library Well explore the fascinating process of electing a new pope in a fun and informative evening open to all As the conclave draws near let us continue to pray for the Cardinal Electors and for the entire Church placing our trust in God's providence The election of the Bishop of Rome carries profound significance for the whole world As revealed in Matthew 16 the Pope is entrusted by our Lord Jesus Christ to lead His Church His Body on earth in His name In this role the pope bears a spiritual authority and pastoral care that extends to all corners of the world Faithfully in the Risen
