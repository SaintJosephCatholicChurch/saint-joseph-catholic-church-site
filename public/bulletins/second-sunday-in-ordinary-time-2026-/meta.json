Sunday in Ordinary Time January 18 2026 This weekend January 17th 18th the Church celebrates the Second Sunday in Ordinary Time As the glory of Christmastide has faded all too quickly away we are left with a simple question Was this Christmas a turning point for us Though the tree goes out the lights come down and the daily routine returns the revelation of the Nativity and manifestation of the Epiphany cannot leave our lives unchanged Our Christmas celebrations cannot simply be a Hallmark moment that quickly fades away This is the single most earth shattering event in human history The Word became man Our duty as Christians doesn't end once the decorations come down This is when the real work starts We don't just admire the mystery we must nowcarry it into the world There is no going back to business as usual Those who have seen Him must make Him known This season of Ordinary Time is meant to continue the manifestation of God to the world Scripturally our readings focus on Jesus teaching healing preaching calling His disciples confronting sin ultimately continuing to reveal who He Truly there's nothing ordinary about this time It's meant to be intense formative and where discipleship is forged Holiness is being worked out in daily prayer obedience discipline and consistency Ordinary Time is the Church reminding us that Christianity is not merely a seasonal hobby Through Christmas we are witnesses of the Incarnation Through Easter we are witnesses of the Resurrection And witnesses don't go back to their ordinary lives as if nothing had happened If we have truly encountered Christ if this Christmas was not just a moment but a turning point for us then nothing in our life will be ordinary ever again The Silent Bells of St Joseph If you like me are accustomed to hearing the church bells ring everyday from the morning to the evening Angelus you may notice a temporary silence for the next few weeks As the equipment for both the St Gabriel bell and the bell carillon is housed in the sacristy it was all disconnected earlier this week as a part of our renovation work Once the work in the sacristy is completed the equipment will be reconnected and our bells will start ringing once more Diocesan Synod Opening Mass for the Parish Session On Monday January 26th at 6 PM we will host our Opening Prayer Session in preparation for our Parish Synod Session At this Mass we will invite the Holy Spirit to guide our hearts as we begin this synodal journey together as a parish Two weeks later on Monday February 9th at 6 PM we will have the opportunity to gather for our Parish Synod Session as our participation in the preparation for the upcoming Diocesan Synod These two sessions are an opportunity for the Faithful of our diocese to prayerfully reflect together on one central question How is our local Church called to live the mission of Christ today and in the years to come Our Parish Synod Session will allow each of us to share our voices prayerful reflections and experiences as a unique and irreplaceable part of our local Church The parish synod will in turn help guide the larger Diocesan Synod At the end of the Parish Synod Session the various insights shared will be compiled and submitted to Bishop Rhoades as a faithful representation of the parish's voice With our contributions and those of the other parishes of our diocese Bishop will set the broader synodal questions for reflection at the Diocesan Synod in November I encourage you to join us for these sessions College students who are away from the parish as also invited to prayerfully participate in a special college synodal session and share their perspective on faith and life on campus Participants are asked to watch a short video message from
