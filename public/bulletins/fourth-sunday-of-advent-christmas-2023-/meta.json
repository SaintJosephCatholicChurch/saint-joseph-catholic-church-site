immediately following the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ Dec 24th 25th We welcome all those joining us as we prepare together and enter into the celebration of the birth of our Savior Jesus Christ Know that you are always welcome here at St Joseph One of the first things you see upon entering the Church this Christmas is the Nativity in the narthex This year marks the 800th anniversary of the first Nativity which was a living nativity scene arranged by St Francis of Assisi in a cave near Greccio Italy St Francis moved by his own travels to the Holy Land wished to invite the local villagers to whom he ministered to gaze upon the babe of Bethlehem leading to his creation of this first Nativity Prior to our 4 PM Christmas Eve Vigil Mass the manger in the Nativity lays empty as a sign of our continued preparation and longing for the babe of Bethlehem To begin our Christmas celebrations the Nativity will be blessed and the Christ child will be placed in the manger at the start of this vigil Mass The Nativity will remain out throughout the Christmas season though we will find the Shepherds give way soon enough for the coming of the Magi In front of the Nativity are two kneelers to allow for individual prayer throughout the Christmas season I encourage you to use our beautiful Nativity and your own at home as a point of prayerful contemplation throughout this entire Christmas season Jesus Christ has entered the world Jesus Christ has entered our world What does this greatest of gifts mean to us today Parish Christmas Gift Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary At Easter we gave out Dr Brant Pitre's Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist which received great feedback from the parish We are following up this work this Christmas with another book from Dr Pitre Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary Unveiling the Mother of the Messiah Quite a fitting read as we enter the Christmas Octave this work goes step by step through the Garden of Eden to the Book of Revelation to reveal how deeply biblical Catholic beliefs about Mary really are Among other titles it helps to show how the Bible itself teaches that Mary is in fact the new Eve the Mother of God the Queen of Heaven and Earth and the new Ark of the Covenant In addition to this gift we received an additional gift of the newest work by Matthew Kelly The Rocking Chair Prophet This work from Dynamic Catholic is both a captivating and imaginative novel that offers a variety of wisdom about relatable experiences common throughout life Mary Mother of God On Monday January 1st the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Mary Mother of God This ancient celebration traced back to the 5th Century and the Council of Ephesus recognizes Mary as Theotokos or God bearer As this celebration falls on Monday this year though a holy day it is not a holy day of obligation this year Though not obligatory may we see it as a holy day of opportunity To celebrate this solemnity and mark the end of the Christmas Octave join us for a special Mass on Monday January 1st at 7 PM Fiducia Supplicans On the Pastoral Meaning of Blessings This past Monday December 18th the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith DDF released a declaration entitled Fiducia Supplicans On the Pastoral Meaning of Blessings As this declaration was quoted heavily often only partially or incorrectly in various media outlets throughout the week I wanted to offer a short summary of the work As always I would encourage you to read the declaration itself available on our parish website to see what it truly says as it truly is a very thoughtful document cont on Page 3 PARISH CALENDAR Sat Dec 23 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Vigil Mass Fourth Sunday of Advent Sun Dec 24 Mass 7:30am Mass 10:00am Fourth Sunday of Advent Sun Dec 24

Eating good food Christmas trees with a star on top Praying and being nice Making crafts Amber Bedwell Grade 1 Fourth Sunday of Advent December 24 2023 Bulletin Column Continued For background the DDF is an office within the Vatican whose focus is to defend Church teaching declaration is a document written by an individual office within the Vatican that offers guidance on how to best put into practice various aspects of Church teaching in the modern world This particular declaration was written by the DDF and recognized by Pope Francis ex audientia meaning that he met with the author to review the text The declaration is itself broken into three main parts review of the Church's teaching on marriage review of the Church's understanding and practice in giving blessings and Pastoral guidance to priests In brief the document reaffirms the Church's consistent teaching on marriage and offers pastoral guidance on how we can walk with individuals who are currently in relationships that are outside of this teaching Specifically the declaration is looking at blessings and the various types of blessings that can be given For example in the marriage ritual there is a specific blessing referred to as the Nuptial Blessing offered to couples who are free and able to marry This blessing is tied directly to the specific union of a man and a woman and cannot be bestowed upon relationships existing outside of this teaching There are however other types of blessings that are available to all people both Catholics and non Catholics alike The declaration refers to this wider range of blessings as spontaneous blessings or blessings asked for by individuals or groups as a means of recognizing God's presence in our lives and our need for Him These blessings offered outside of any liturgical context are always and always have been freely given with the understanding that when one asks for such a blessing one is expressing a petition for God's assistance a plea to live better and confidence in a Father who can help us live better Given this understanding of spontaneous blessings even those who are not in a position to approach the Sacraments are able to request such a blessing as a recognition of our constant need of God's help in our lives It is suggested that such spontaneous blessings can be used as a pastoral way to walk with couples in irregular situations eg those married outside of the Church and individuals in same sex relationships spontaneous blessing is not to be confused with an acceptance of such relationships but instead an encouragement to the individuals involved in their desire to grow closer to God As the declaration concludes it is hoped that all those who request such a spontaneous blessing receive it as a means to open one's life to God to ask for His help to live better and also to invoke the Holy Spirit so that the values of the Gospel may be lived with greater faithfulness Faithfully in the Babe of Bethlehem Fr David I would
