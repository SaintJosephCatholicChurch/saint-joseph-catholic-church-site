  "text": "Thirteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 2 2023 Join us Tuesday July 4th at 9 AM for Mass to begin our Independence Day celebrations by first giving thanks to God for the great freedoms that we enjoy This weekend July 1st 2nd the Church celebrates the Thirteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings focus on the theme of God's generosity Diocesan Mission Speaker Fr Patrick Bergin Due to unexpected travel issues for Fr Andrew Mlele we are now welcoming Fr Patrick Bergin from the Archdiocese of Tabora in Tanzania for our Masses this weekend Fr Bergin is a native of Peoria Illinois and served in Tabora with the US Peace Corps After the Peace Corps he continued his outreach working for and eventually leading the African Wildlife Foundation for 16 years before pursuing a vocation to the priesthood Given his life experience Fr Bergin pursued his vocation to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Tabora and now serves our brothers and sisters in Tanzania Part of his ministry includes serving as a mission speaker to help raise awareness and support for the various needs facing his diocese Thank you for your warm welcome to Fr Bergin this weekend and your generous support of his cause The Confirmation Challenge Grace Before Meals Our Did You Know Campaign is on break this weekend as we welcome our mission speaker We will resume with the Sacrament of Confession next weekend For this weekend however I would like to extend The Confirmation Challenge Similar to the weekly Lenten Challenges extended during Lent this challenge offers one simple suggestion in how to concretely live out the grace of our Confirmation in the everyday of our lives The Sacrament of Confirmation calls us to be missionary witnesses of Jesus in our families neighborhoods society and the world One way to witness to the Lord is through our prayer life In this challenge I would encourage you to say grace before meals if you don't already do so Whether eating alone or as a group at home or in a restaurant start your meal with the Sign of the Cross and a short prayer giving thanks to God for all that we are about to receive Though a seemingly small act this form of prayer especially when offered in public serves as a witness to Jesus and utilizes the Holy Spirit's gift of piety It also uses two of the most ancient prayers of our Faith The Sign of the Cross which dates back to the earliest days of the Church and the traditional blessing before meals dating from the Gelasian Sacramentary of the 8th Century This moment of prayer though seemingly mundane can have a great impact on our lives and that of others as it reminds us to keep God at the center of our days Suggested Grace Before Meals Prayer Bless us Lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord Amen Fresh Cut Flowers on the Altar As Spring has sprung and Summer is in full swing the flowers from our parish gardens are in bloom This means that we are once again blessed to enjoy their beauty in the sanctuary thanks to the hard work of Louise Mayer The use of fresh cut flowers in the sanctuary is strongly encouraged when possible over the use of artificial flowers by our national Bishops Conference USCCB The importance of using fresh flowers is described in Built of Living Stones guidelines put forward by the USCCB Described in paragraph 129 The use of living flowers serves as a reminder of the gift of life God has given to the human community Starting as nothing but a small seed flowers if nurtured and cared for will sprout and grow Nourished by water and the sun they bloom and show forth their beauty to the world The life of the flower is a visual reminder of the spiritual life Christian life starts first with the seed of faith It must be planted in the heart and nurtured through the Sacraments Finally it blossoms and shows forth its beauty when nourished by that supernatural light and heavenly warmth which radiates forth from the sun of the
