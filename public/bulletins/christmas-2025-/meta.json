  "text": "The House of Christmas Chesterton Step softly under snow or rain To find the place where men can pray The way is all so very plain That we may lose the way Oh we have learnt to peer and pore On tortured puzzles from our youth We know all labyrinthine lore We are the three wise men of yore And we know all things but the truth We have gone round and round the hill And lost the wood among the trees And learnt long names for every ill And served the mad gods naming still The furies the Eumenides The gods of violence took the veil Of vision and philosophy The Serpent that brought all men bale He bites his own accursed tail And calls himself Eternity Go humbly it has hailed and snowed With voices low and lanterns lit So very simple is the road That we may stray from it The world grows terrible and white And blinding white the breaking day We walk bewildered in the light For something is too large for sight And something much too plain to say The Child that was ere worlds begun We need but walk a little way We need but see a latch undone The Child that played with moon and sun Is playing with a little hay The house from which the heavens are fed The old strange house that is our own Where trick of words are never said And Mercy is as plain as bread And Honour is as hard as stone Go humbly humble are the skies And low and large and fierce the Star So very near the Manger lies That we may travel far Hark Laughter like a lion wakes To roar to the resounding plain And the whole heaven shouts and shakes For God Himself is born again And we are little children walking Through the snow and rain Faithfully in Christ Fr David The Nativity of Jesus Christ December 25 2025 Merry Christmas Whether you are a lifelong parishioner or a visiting guest we are so happy to celebrate the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ with you May our Lord fill your heart with the true joy of His peace as we rejoice together in the birth of the Savior If this is your first time here at St Josephs or if you are recently returning we would love to welcome you back every weekend throughout the full Christmas season and beyond As it took us four long weeks of Advent to reach Christmas Day may we not forget that our celebration has only just now begun The joy of Christmas cannot be contained in a single day but is instead in the life of the Church a season within itself I encourage you keep the tree up Let the Christmas lights shine Listen to Christmas music Christ is born What more reason do we need to continue celebrating Rejoice for the Savior is born Our Christmas celebrations are made more joyous by your presence here This year is perhaps even more special as we conclude our 150th Anniversary marking not only a milestone in our parish history but also a renewed call to welcome Christ into our parish our families and our hearts Looking ahead to the months to come this Christmas also finds us on the threshold of renewal With major renovations set to begin we give thanks for the generations who have handed on the faith to us and entrust this next chapter of our parish to the Lord who is born anew among us We prayerfully ask the Christ child to guide our parish through this time of transition that all we do may serve His glory and strengthen the faith of generations yet to come Papal Blessing to Mark our Anniversary Year Shortly after arriving at St Joseph's in 2018 I had the opportunity to travel to Rome for the diaconate ordination of now Fr Spenser St Louis a priest of our diocese As a part of that trip I passed through St Anne's Gate into the Vatican City State and found the Vaticans Office of Papal Charities Through this office the Faithful can request a papal blessing from the Pope for major events in one's life or in the life of the Church At that time I requested a special blessing for our parish by the late Holy Father Pope Francis I During my travels this year I once again traced this same path and requested a papal blessing from Pope Leo XIV this Christmas in honor of our parish's 150th Anniversary This Papal Blessing to end our anniversary year marks the culmination of our anniversary celebrations and serves as a tangible sign of our communion with the Holy Father and the universal Church The Papal Blessing right reads as follows The Holy Father Leo XIV cordially imparts the requested Apostolic Blessing to St Joseph Rev David Violi and all the Faithful of the Parish on the occasion of the 150th Parish Anniversary invoking through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary an abundance of divine graces With humble gratitude to everyone who sent a card or Christmas gift Thank you To my Parish Family may God bless you and your family abundantly in the coming New year Know of my continued prayers for you and your family Michelle I would like to say thank you to the Adult Choir Childrens Choir Cantors and Musicians for all the hard work you have done in preparation for our Lords Nativity May Jesus bless you with His peace Teresa The Second Grade Religious Education Class The family gets to come together and they get to have fun It is Jesus birthday We are celebrating the Savior's birthday Gather with my family to celebrate God Jesus and Family I think of my uncle and my cousins and we get together at a hotel and we play games The First Grade Religious Education Class

lighting We eat Christmas ham and prime rib at Christmas Eve dinner It means spending time with Grandmas and Grandpas other family and playing board Christmas is the best time of the year My favorite part is gathering with family and friends to celebrate Jesus birthday To me Christmas means loving Jesus and showing kindness to others And of course Christmas cookies By Lincoln Fosnaugh Grade 4 Christmas is a time to reflect on our past year with the Lord and what we want next year to look like Christmas is about family and remembering the life of Jesus It means remembering no love will ever be greater and he came in the humblest way possible Christmas is a time to think about what we can give Jesus Christmas in a way can be about the gifts but only if it is what you can give to the Lord He has given us the best gift imaginable of forgiving our sins and the option of heaven We can never repay that but we can start to try For me Christmas is reflecting on how I can do better by the Lord and how I can make him more proud of me Christmas is a time to rejoice and be thankful for the sacrifice of God and be grateful for the people He has placed into our lives and the blessings He has given us Christmas is when I get to go to Midnight Mass and repeat my favorite tradition with the Lord Christmas to me is a time I get to look back at all the blessings God has given me through this year that I didnt realize in the moment By Ellie Coyne Grade 11 Christmas to me is celebrating the birth of Jesus with my family We can enjoy being together and being grateful for what we have It reminds me of what really matters By Macy McNabb Grade 8 To me Christmas means spending time with my family and remember that God loves us I like how everything feels more peaceful and everyone tries to be a little kinder Decorating the tree and talking about Jesus birth helps me feel closer to God and the people I care about By Zoe Draper Grade 6 Knights of Columbus Father Aloysius Phillips
