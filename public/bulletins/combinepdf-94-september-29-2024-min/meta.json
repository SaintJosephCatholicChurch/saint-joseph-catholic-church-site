Twenty Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time September 29 2024 This weekend Sept 28th 29th the Church celebrates the Twenty sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings continue the theme of challenging us as disciples of the Lord We are called to recognize how God is working both in our lives and in the lives of others Once we recognize His presence in our lives how committed are we to follow after Him in all things Parish Picnic Join us next weekend for the Parish Picnic on Sunday Oct 6th following the 10 AM Mass What a joyous time to join together in prayer and fraternity Forty Days for Life This past weekend our Knights of Columbus and a number of volunteers helped set up our parish's annual Forty Days for Life display Set on the north side of our parish campus 300 crosses have been placed as a memorial to the unborn and all those affected by abortion in Wells County Throughout these next forty days we are invited to pray and fast in a special way for an end to the evils of abortion in our county our nation and throughout the world St Vincent de Paul Stuff the Truck Next weekend we are partnering with the St Vincent de Paul Society in Decatur for a Stuff the Truck event This event is an opportunity for us to help support the St Vincent de Paul Thrift Store ministry of our neighboring parish St Mary of the Assumption in nearby Decatur This ministry helps to provide those in need with clothing and furniture Please see the flyer in this weekend's bulletin for more information Annual Bishop's Appeal Having received a mailing from Bishop Rhoades earlier this month we have kicked off the Annual Bishop's Appeal The annual appeal video is now available for viewing on our parish website alongside an option for online donations Additional pledge cards are available in the narthex and can be returned either in the collection basket any weekend or to the Parish Office during the week Thank you for prayerfully discerning how the Lord is calling you to support the appeal this year Introductory Rites to the Liturgy of the Word Following the joyful prayer of the Gloria we join together in praying the Collect This opening prayer intoned by the priest is meant to gather all the intentions of the people participating in the Mass and raises it up together as one prayer on behalf of the congregation The word itself collect comes from the Latin collecta which means the gathering of people together How appropriate for a prayer that collects many into one As the Collect concludes we move from the Introductory Rites into the Liturgy of the Word Though as we have seen we have already turned to the Scriptures several times throughout the Introductory Rites we now focus on them in a special way The order of readings reflects the order of God's redemptive plan ordinarily moving from the Old to the New from Israel to the Church with the Gospel serving as the pinnacle of our readings It is through the Liturgy of the Word that we are being prepared for the Liturgy of the Eucharist In hearing the word of God proclaimed our hearts are being prepared to receive the very Word of God Himself Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist These two are so closely connected that they form but one single act of worship Let us then listen attentively to these sacred readings so that our souls may be lit by the proclamation of the word of God In these readings we hear the story of salvation with Jesus at the center May we always remember that we are not mere bystanders in this story of salvation history which climaxes in the person of Jesus Each of our stories our lives with its joys pains uncertainties and mysteries are part of His story It is literally the best story you will ever read and more than that experience Weekend of October 5th and 6th 500 Mike Morrissey
