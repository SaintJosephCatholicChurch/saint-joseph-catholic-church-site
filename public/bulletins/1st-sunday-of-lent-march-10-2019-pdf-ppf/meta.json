special Welcome Home to all of our university students who are home during their spring break May you have a restful and renewing visit home and know that you remain in our prayers as you continue your studies Though our ashes from Ash Wednesday have now faded away their call to an interior conversion of heart remains ever present as we enter into this First Sunday of Lent Historically Lent served as a time of preparation for those preparing to enter into the Church at Easter It was spoken about by the early Church Fathers including St Irenaeus the 2nd Century Bishop of Lyons as he discussed the different practices of fasting in preparation for Easter between the Eastern and Western Church St Cyril the 4th Century Bishop of Jerusalem encouraged this intense period of fasting during Lent among those catechumens preparing to enter the Church In the 5th Century Pope St Leo the Great noted the apostolic origins of these 40 days of preparation for Easter These forty days are seen as a way for Christians of each age to join in our Lords forty days in the desert which we hear in our Gospel today Luke 4113 The goal of these forty days is to transform the world by first transforming the individual As we enter into this ancient season of Lent we are called to observe it through acts of prayer fasting and almsgiving These three pillars of Lent serve as the source of our individual transformation Each of these three acts call us outside of our selves and into a deeper relationship with both God and neighbor If we are willing to take seriously this season participate in these three pillars of Lent and strive for con version throughout these forty days we will see miraculous changes both in ourselves and with God working through us in others As difficult as it might seem we can even begin to see a change in the world itself Though this claim may seem almost impossible we must remember that all things are possible with God Matthew 1926 As a parish we will be taking up a special act of almsgiving an act of char ity during these forty days through our Lenten Food Collection There is a box placed in the vestibule that will remain throughout Lent for canned goods and non perishable food items Each week all donated items will be given to one of our local food resourcespantries in Wells County Though this might seem a simple or small act of charity it is one that can do great good for our brothers and sisters in need right here in our own community When we work together as the Body of Christ we can do great things Even the smallest act when done for God is never wasted Throughout these forty days we will also have several opportunities as a parish to gather together in prayer in addition to our normal Mass times I would encour age you if possible to join us each Friday for Stations of the Cross in the Church at 7 PM This tradition of the Via Crucis is a prayerful devotion in which we meditate upon and walk with our Lord to His Cross Historically this devotion arose from the many pilgrims would travel to the Holy Land and walk the Via Dolorosa or the route believed to be that which was walked by our Lord Himself as He carried the Cross to Calvary By the 13th Century these holy sites were under the custodial care of the Franciscan Order In the 15th Century the Franciscans began to erect outdoor shrines throughout the world of these holy sites similar to how St Francis himself began the tradition of the nativity scene in the 13th Century This allowed those who could not travel to the Holy Land to have the Holy Land come to them This devotional practice of praying the Stations of our Lords Passion and Death quickly spread among the faithful By the 17th and 18th Centuries the stations become commonplace within churches throughout the world just as we have in our church today Though we are encouraged to privately pray the Stations of the Cross every Friday throughout the year as well as to commit ourselves weekly to some form of fasting we do so together as a parish family throughout Lent In this way we are able to unite each Friday with Good Friday and to unite our own sufferings and sacrifices to the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the Cross In uniting ourselves to the Lord on Good Friday we are through His grace be prepared to be united with Him on Easter Sunday In Christ Fr David
