  "text": "IGHTEENTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME August 2 2020 This weekend August 1st2nd the Church celebrates the 18th Sunday in Ordinary Time Having completed the third great discourse of St Matthews Gospel we are now preparing to enter into the fourth discourse In this discourse our blessed Lord is preparing for the establishment of His Church here on earth As seen in todays Gospel of the Feeding of the Five Thousand Matthew 141321 our blessed Lord gives the bread that He Himself blessed to those crowds gathered through the hands of His disciples In the same way the Church continues to hand on trdere to us that which our blessed Lord Himself has blessed Indiana Executive Order and Diocesan Safety Precautions This past weekend Governor Holcomb issued a new executive order regarding the requirement of face coverings in public areas Please know that as our diocesan directives are already in full compliance with this executive order there will be no changes at this time to the general prac tices that we have already been observing in church I thank you again for your patience and understanding as we strive to offer Mass while respecting the safety precautions put into place by Bishop Rhoades at all parishes in our diocese Summer Classes and Summer Vacation This past week I completed and hopefully passed the final examinations in my last two courses Procedural Law and Special Issues Lay Ministry for this summer semester I am done with classes until we begin the Fall semester online in three weeks This Fall my classes will include SupraDiocesan Structures and Readings in Canonical Latin During these next three weeks without classes I am looking forward to working on a few projects around the parish and rectory I will also be taking a few days away from the parish on the weekend of August 15th16th On that Saturday I will be witnessing the marriage of one of our parishioners and his fiance at St Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in West Lafayette and that Sunday I will be in South Bend to baptize my nephew and spend a few days with my parents and siblings We will be welcoming a visiting priest whom I will announce in next weeks bulletinnewsletter once all arrangements are finalized for Confessions on Saturday and as the celebrant at our weekend Masses Adoration and Sacramentals This coming Friday August 7th is the first Friday of the month and we will as has become our parish custom have all day Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament Following the 11:30AM morning Mass the Most Holy Eucharist will be exposed in the Church for Adoration from Noon until 6:00PM Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament will conclude will Benediction followed by our First Friday Votive of the Sacred Heart offered according to the Extraordinary Form Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament is an amazing thing It is in reality the most amazing thing The True Presence of Jesus Christ under the appearance of bread and wine During times of adoration we have the blessed opportunity to sit in the presence of Jesus Christ in the Most Holy Eucharist As St Clare of Assisi said in the 13th Century it is our opportunity to gaze upon Him consider Him contemplate Him as we desire to imitate Him One might ask Cant we find God everywhere Yes Gods presence is reflected in all of creation He is the Creator But the Most Holy Eucharist is different It is no reflection It is Christ Himself On these hot humid days of summer we are reminded that water is present everywhere in the air But when we need to drink we still must go to the well We can and should reflect on the beauty of God in all of creation but we still must go to the well to Jesus Christ in the Most Holy Eucharist Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday August 1 8:00am Special Intention

David and I are very excited to announce that we have a new book for our Religious Education Program Grades 18 here at St Josephs Bishop Rhoades has approved the use of Ignatius Press Faith and Life Series for Diocesan Religious Education Programs and we will begin using the new curriculum this fall The Faith and Life Series provides a basic foundation of faith and love of Jesus Christ through which students respond to Gods call in prayer mercy and justice Each year has a systematic approach covering foundational truths of the Faith as presented in the Catechism of the Catholic Church It evangelizes families and entire parishes and nurtures the theological virtues of Faith Hope and Charity You will be notified in the coming future what the plans are for returning to the classroom this fall Stay tuned"
