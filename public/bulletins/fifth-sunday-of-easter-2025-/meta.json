Sunday of Easter Our readings continue to prepare us for the coming of the Ascension of the Lord and the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost Our Lord desired to establish His Kingdom on Earth present in and through His Church To do this He first ascended to the Father The disciples had to learn to shed their physical attachment to the Lord to live by faith rather than sight Though He ascended to the Father He did not abandon His disciples Aid came through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost Absence followed by renewal is a strong theme in the whole of the Mass for this Sunday Loss becomes gain Waiting becomes fulfillment Uncertainty becomes clarity Pain becomes joy Through the coming of the Holy Spirit the Church discovers a radiant beginning This is the age in which we now live Baby Bottles for Helping Hands As mentioned last weekend you are invited to take a Baby Bottle home with you Baby Bottles can be taken and filled with loose change dollar bills andor checks to support Helping Hands Serving as a local pregnancy and family resource centers Helping Hands provides a wide range of services for those in need within our local community This annual fundraiser is one of the ways that our parish helps them to continue offering support for those in need Please return the Baby Bottles either in the weekly collection basket or to the Parish Office by Father's Day Weekend Sunday June 15th If including a check in the Baby Bottle please make it payable to Helping Hands Thank you for your support of this local ministry in our community Ordination to the Diaconate With praise and thanksgiving Bishop Rhoades will ordain Johnathon Hickey Noah Isch Samuel Martinez and Greenan Sullivan to the transitional diaconate for our diocese this coming Saturday May 24 at 11am at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Fort Wayne All are welcome for the Mass of Ordination Following ordination our new deacons will serve in parishes throughout the diocese this summer before returning to seminary to complete their formation for priestly ordination Our diocese remains richly blessed with a number of young men preparing for priesthood We give thanks to the Lord for their response to His call and continue to pray for an increase in vocations both across the diocese and from within our own parish family Inaugural Mass of Pope Leo XIV On Sunday morning our Holy Father Pope Leo XIV celebrated the inaugural Mass of his papacy at the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran the cathedral church of the Diocese of Rome Though he assumed the Office of the Papacy at the moment of his election this inaugural Mass marks the formal and public beginning of his ministry as the Bishop of Rome At this Mass he receives the pallium a white woolen band adorned with red crosses and the Fisherman's Ring Together these symbols represent the Pope's universal jurisdiction and authority as the Vicar of Christ in continuity with that unbroken line of succession back to St Peter himself These sacred signs emphasize the Pope's role as the visible source of unity for the Church on earth entrusted to him for the good of the whole People of God Recently Pope Leo XIV's papal shield was revealed The upper half blue with a white fleur de lis symbolizes purity devotion to the Blessed Virgin and the resurrection of Jesus The lower half features a closed book beneath a pierced flaming heart an image evoking St Augustine's conversion and the way God's Word pierced his heart His motto In Illo Uno Unum In the One We Are One taken from St Augustine further underscores the unity centrality of Christ in our lives ORG Our Parish Code 7N68MY Weekend of May 24th 25th 5:00pm Dan Lautzenheiser 7:30am Teresa Smith 10:00am Adult Choir 5:00pm Ginny Fenstermaker
