and presence at St Josephs this past month and wish him Gods blessing as he returns to the Cathedral in Fort Wayne For the remainder of July we welcome Fr Tommy Lane to St Josephs Fr Lane is a priest from the Diocese of Cloyne in County Cork Ireland and for the past fif teen years has served as a professor of Sacred Scripture at Mount St Marys Seminary in Emmitsburg MD Welcome to St Josephs Fr Lane special Welcome to all those who are joining us for the extended 4th of July weekend Welcome to St Josephs It is my prayer that all have a blessed holiday and that God may keep all travelers this weekend safe in His loving care Our bulletin cover is an image of the main entryway of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception The central sculpture in the Ro man archway that frames the main door is a relief of the Annunciation This relief sits atop the greeting of the Archangel Gabriel to our Blessed Mother Hail Mary Full of Grace The Lord is with Thee Luke 128 From this greeting comes the biblical basis for the title of Mary as the Immaculate Conception In the Gospel St Luke relates Gabriels greeting to Mary by using the Greek word kecharitomene This word used only once in the Scriptures is taken from a Greek verb charit meaning to give grace Kecharitomene is in the past perfect tense of this verb roughly meaning one who is and has always been given grace Gabriel uses this word not as a verb but as an adjective referring to Mary For Mary being full of grace is not simply an action but her very identity Before she was the Mother of God theotokos Luke 143 before she was Mother of the Church mater ecclesiae John 1927 she was kecharitomene or full of grace Luke 128 Mary received this great gift as a result of that singular privilege and grace granted by God in view of the merits of Jesus Christ the Savior of the hu man race This explanation was beautifully written of by Piux IX in his constitu tion Ineffabilis Deus which defined ex cathedra the dogma of the Immaculate Conception This dogma as with all things Marian points us to Jesus Christ In the same way when you enter the Shrine through this door you see before you an image of our Lord Mary always leads us to Jesus Flanking the main door and the relief of the Annunciation are on the left the women of the Old Testament who prefigured Mary Sarah Miriam Ruth and Naomi These women lived lives that anticipated in some form the role of Mary in the New Testament On the right we find the prominent women of the New Testament Elizabeth Anna Mary and Martha and the Samaritan Woman Each of these women were greatly involved in some manner in the lives of Jesus and Mary It is truly amazing how much theology and biblical scholarship we can find in a simple doorway All of this imagery is before our eyes before weve even entered the Shrine itself Just like the Blessed Mother every aspect of a church building is meant to point us to Jesus In the same way our very lives as disciples of the Lord who have been sent out like the seventytwo are meant to reflect Jesus to the world Let us ask ourselves a simple question this weekend When someone looks at us do they see Jesus Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF JULY 1314 2019 CANTORS 500 Leeann Kennerck 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Nancy Leitz LECTORS 500 Glenn Ryan 730 Sarah McCorkle 1000 John Vanderkolk EUCHARISTIC MINISTERS 500 Kathy
