in Ordinary Time October 12 2025 This weekend October 11th 12th the Church celebrates the Twenty Eighth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings highlight the theme of gratitude for the great gift of salvation Gratitude is meant to transform the heart As such this Gospel invites us to ask ourselves Are we grateful for the gift of salvation Are we like the leper who returned to give thanks or are we like the other nine who accepted the gift but forgot the Giver In our daily life do we pause to acknowledge God's blessings or do we get lost in life's busyness Throughout the month of October there are a many feast days celebrated for well known saints such as St Thrse of Lisieux Oct 1st St Francis of Assisi Oct 4th and Pope St John Paul II Oct 22nd This coming Friday Oct 17th the Church celebrates the feast of St Ignatius of Antioch As we continue our theme for this liturgical year Living with the Saints this is a Saint I would strongly encourage you to learn more about St Ignatius of Antioch is known as an early Church Father or a Saint who was influential in the life of the early St Ignatius is considered one of the earliest Church Fathers known specifically as an Apostolic Father This means that he was a contemporary of the Apostles In his case he was a direct disciple of St John the Apostle having the Faith handed on to him by one who received the Faith itself from the very preaching of our Lord Himself St Ignatius served as the third Bishop of Antioch Tradition holds that St Peter knowing St Ignatius from his time in Antioch was the one who appointed him to this position Like the Apostles St Ignatius earned the crown of martyrdom being thrown to wild beasts in the Roman arena Like St Paul he wrote letters to various local churches after he was imprisoned and was being brought from Antioch to Rome for his execution Seven of St Ignatius letters remain Six to the local churches he passed through on his way to martyrdom and one to St Polycarp a fellow disciple of St John the Apostle and a close friend The authenticity of these letters are undisputed even to our modern day This means that through the writings of St Ignatius we gain insight in how the Faith was both understood and practiced as the Gospel message was first proclaimed to the world In reading the writings of St Ignatius we find a man of deep faith writing with a father's heart He urges the early Christians to remain united with their bishop to guard against false teachers and to cling to Christ's presence in the Holy Eucharist St Ignatius was one of the earliest voices to speak so clearly about the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist recognizing the flesh of Jesus Christ as the medicine of immortality and antidote against death St Ignatius greatly stressed how unity in the Church is not an optional matter but is rooted in obedience to Jesus Christ through communion with the bishop and the wider Church His letters reflect both the tenderness of a shepherd and the boldness of a martyr who longed with a readiness to be united with His Lord writing enroute to his martyrdom I prefer death in Christ Jesus to power over the farthest limits of the earth
