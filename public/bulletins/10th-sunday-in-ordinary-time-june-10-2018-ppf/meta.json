parishioners Greetings in the Lord and greetings to you I want to thank God for His blessings and guidance since I came here in 2013 to work in your midst and with you Thanks to all of you especially those who have been cooperat ing with me May the Good Lord reward each of you according to your good works In order to foster growth Spiritually socially and otherwise in our parish I formed the following teams 1 NEW EVANGELIZATION TEAM It helps us spreading the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ It helps peo ple to become a personal Disciple of the Lord It creates opportunities for deepening of Faith and deeper understanding of our Religion It has conducted the Alpha Program and it is about to organize a week end Marriage Encounter for our parishioners and others in our com munity 2 ANNUAL BISHOPS APPEAL TEAM The team has created a wonderful awareness of the Bishops Appeal to our parishioners which resulted in a high level of participation We reached our Diocesan Goal and got overage retuned to us every year Each year we got back overage of about 1000000 to 1200000 3 VOCATION TEAM Whose work is to create awareness on Priestly and Religious Voca tions The importance cannot be over emphasized 4 STEWARDSHIP TEAM They have done a lot in helping our parishioners to realize how best to serve God with their TIME TALENT AND TREASURE They are now educating themselves on their responsibility to God and the Church with their Time and Talents SPIRITUAL GROWTH OF PARISHIONERS Your spiritual growth is one of my priority Thus we were able to organize a weekend retreat talk for you Thanks to Knight of Columbus who sponsored it And since then we have held Mission Week Spiritual Talks for you two times Through my homilies and instructions you have grown in the reception of the sacraments especially the Sacraments of the Holy Eucharist and Penance ConfessionReconciliation You know it is difficult to notice spiritual growth very easily But the frequency of your Sacrament of Penance is evident Thanks to God for that for some of you now go to Confession very regularly biweekly Please keep it up For the first time in the parish I formed ExtraOrdinary Eucharistic Ministers for the Homebound and these our brothers and sisters now receive Holy Communion every Sunday and on weekdays twice a month for their Confes sions and Anointing when needed I also introduced 1 The praying of the Rosary before Holy Masses at the weekends 2 Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament the Holy Eucharist every Tuesday from 700 to 8:00am 3 One Day Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament the Holy Eucharist every first Thursday of the month from 8:30am to 7:00pm 4 Celebration of Holy Mass at River Tress Estate every last Thursday of the month at 10:30am from there visit the sick Aged Homebound and Hospitals for their Holy Communion Confessions and Anointing as needed The amount needed each week to make budget is 511640 We are 47760 ahead of budget from last week and 64116 ahead of budget

from me We received an Email from Rick Singer who has been coordinating with the Parish Building Committee the fixing of our Parking Lot He said the parking lot had so much deteriorated more than we were told Therefore work was suspended FINANCES I want to thank all of you for your wonderful financial support of our Parish When I came here on August 1 2013 the total money we had in the savings with the Diocese was 12184108 Since then apart from the day to day and month to month ex penditures that we run we have spent about 2800000 in tak ing care of our parish Then we have added 14330212 to our savings with the Diocese So as of May ending we have a total of 25159618 in the savings with the Diocese And a total of 1354702 in the checking account Thus we have a grand total of 26514320 Two Hundred and sixtyfive Thousand one hundred and forty three US Dollars twenty cents in the banks That is a huge saving finances for our Parish Thank you for your generosity PARISH FACILITIES Early in 2014 I organized with the Parish and Finance Councils a tour of our parish facilities to determine the life span of those things such as The heating system the air conditioning units water heater units etc We discovered that their life span is be tween 5 to 10 years Thus we need to get ready for any emer gency in breakdown of any of those units Since then we have changed three AC units We paid 300000 for the first one that broke down and paid 50000 for another two AC as in surance helped to pay for these two And to prepare for any future financial need in agreement with the Parish Council and Finance Council I introduced the Rainy Day Fund which helped a lot in raising our finances Since I came we have 1 Repaired one of the Rest Rooms in the Rectory at about 600000 2 Painted the Block Walls in the Church 3 Washed all stone and block Walls of the Church Parish Office the Rectory and outside Walls that cost about 1500000 4 We also fixed Sacristy and other sections behind the Altar stairs down to the social hall and those areas that were in bad shape for a long time at about 500000 Thanks to St Josephs Catholic Council of Women who helped financially 5 We are in the process of fixing the parking lot that was ne glected for a long time that it is now crumbling That will be done soon There are still a few other things that can be written but be cause of time and space let these suffice for your information May God who knows everything that has happened reward each of you according to your work Never allow yourself to be used in blocking or black mailing someone Always stand for the truth For the truth shall make you free free in truth and in deed There is no time to organize farewell party for me If you pa rishioners and the new pastor feel it is OK you can organize a party at a later date for me and invite me As things stand now an official letter and announcement are yet to be made as to where I am to be posted May God continue to bless the Family of Families of St Joseph Bluffton Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Mr Rick Singer will get more information and when the new pastor Rev Fr David Violi comes the Parish Council the Finance Council the Building Committee and Fr David Violi will revisit the fixing of the parking lot arrangement and be properly and rightly informed and advised by Rick and those who do the work and then they will discuss what next to do For details on what Rick Singer wrote read the Bulle tin insert God bless you Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu People hate the truth for the sake of whatever it is that they love more than the truth They love truth when it shines warmly on them and hate it when it rebukes them St Augustine Carl Goodwin 19222008 David Goodwin Douglas Cale Mitch Harnish DUNWIDDIE HEATING PLUMBING AC 8241999 Over 25
