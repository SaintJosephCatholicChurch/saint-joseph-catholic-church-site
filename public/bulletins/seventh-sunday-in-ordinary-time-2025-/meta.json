1554 58 Lk 639 45 Seventh Sunday in Ordinary Time February 23 2025 This weekend Feb 22nd 23rd the Church celebrates the Seventh Sunday in Ordinary Time With the start of Lent is only a week and a half away we continue to be reminded of our need to prepare for this coming season Liturgically this need for preparation has been reflected in the readings of our weekday Masses The weekday lectionary differing from our three year Sunday lectionary cycle is now walking us through the Book of Genesis Starting at the beginning we have been reminded of the Fall of Adam and Eve Just as Adam and Eve were sent forth from the garden to toil over the earth so we will soon be sent into the wilderness of Lent During these forty days we will pray fast and labor recognizing the weight of sin in our lives These lenten practices are done not as an end in themselves but because through them we come to see our need for our Redeemer Jesus Christ This journey will itself begin of course on Ash Wednesday The ashes placed on our foreheads will mark the dust of exile but the Cross which they trace is the promise of victory Christ the new Adam takes upon Himself the toil of fallen man He humbles Himself walking the road of suffering and undoing Adam's disobedience by His perfect obedience Where Adam hid from God Christ cries out Into Your hands I commend My Spirit Throughout Lent we will spend these forty days walking with and trying to more closely imitate the Lord We won't shy away from the weight of sin Instead we recognize that the exile from Eden was not the end of our story It is only the beginning of our redemption The walk towards Calvary now is not one of despair but expectation The head of the serpent has been crushed and Christ has opened the way back to the Father As this forty day journey of conversion quickly approaches we must now continue our preparations for it We are called to stand ready and be prepared to follow after Jesus Let us use these remaining days to look into our hearts with an honest gaze What is keeping us from Jesus Where do we need the Lord's healing and grace And these coming forty days what can we sacrifice or change to embrace the Lord more fully in our lives Ash Wednesday Mass Times To enter the Lenten season we will offer three Masses on Ash Wednesday March 5th at 7:00AM Noon and 7:00PM Entering us into the penitential season that is Lent we receive ashes a biblical sign of penance cf Jeremiah 622 26 Jonah 35 6 Job 426 Daniel 93 6 These ashes both signify the sinfulness of the human condition and mark the beginning of the way of conversion that leads to Easter Living with the Saints St Polycarp of Smyrna Our Saint Profile this weekend reminds us of the true historical nature of our Faith throughout time St Polycarp lived only one generation removed from the Lord Himself He learned the Faith at the feet of the beloved Apostle St John The story of his martyrdom is the first written account of a Christian martyr outside of the Sacred Scriptures The life of St Polycarp is one of great importance in understanding how the Faith was first lived and spread The life of this Apostolic Church Father one who knew the Apostles or was greatly influenced by them and bishop of Smyrna an ancient Greek city was recorded in numerous works from the same period Even today at least one full letter from St Polycarp himself is preserved In his letter to the Church of Philippi St Polycarp emphasized the need for faith and righteousness while urging perseverance in the Body of Christ and avoidance of false teachers St Polycarp's feast day actually falls today Sunday Feb 23rd Just as we saw last week that a feast day can be moved it can also be trumped by a higher celebration And as every Sunday serves as a celebration of the Resurrection it takes precedence over individual feast day Yet we can take solace in knowing that St Polycarp would have it no other way given his dying declaration Hear me declare with boldness I am a Christian Weekend of March 1st 2nd 500 Dan Lautzenheiser 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Jay CrispAdult Choir 500 Ginny Fenstermaker 730 Sarah McCorkle 1000 Mike Dunn 500 Laurisa Roper 730
