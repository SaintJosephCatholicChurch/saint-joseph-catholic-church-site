2025 This weekend June 21st 22nd the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Corpus Christi a feast honoring our belief in the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist First proclaimed by Christ Himself in the Bread of Life Discourse John 6 the Eucharist is called the source and summit of the Christian life CCC 1324 1327 for in it is contained the whole spiritual good of the Church Christ Himself From the earliest centuries the Church has professed this truth In AD 110St Ignatius of Antioch a disciple of St John the Apostle proclaimed that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ In AD 151St Justin Martyr explained to the Roman Emperor that the food which has been made into the Eucharist is both the flesh and the blood of the incarnated Jesus Tertullian writing in AD 210 stated that our flesh feeds in the Eucharist on the Body and Blood of Christ few decades later St Augustine taught the newly baptized That bread which you see on the altar is the Body of Christ and the Blood of Christ And in AD 350St Cyril of Jerusalem asked Who would dare to doubt any longer that the Eucharist is Jesus Body since He Himself has declared it Century after century the witness remains the same The Eucharist is not a mere symbol but the Body Blood Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ His Real Presence among us Today's Solemnity invites us to worship the Lord with gratitude and to go forth in our Eucharistic procession so that the whole world might encounter the Lord in our midst May have asked where our new Book of the Gospels came from As the old saying goes Appearances can be deceiving Given frequent handling our Book of the Gospels has accumulated noticeable wear and tear As such it is now protected with an embroidered slipcover to help protect it from further damage This new cover utilizes Eastern iconography to depict scenes of the Crucifixion and the Anastasis or the Harrowing of Hell By placing these scenes on the cover this is a visual testimony that the Gospel is not merely a record of Christ's words and deeds but the living proclamation of His Paschal Mystery His suffering death descent among the dead and resurrection The cover becomes a theological statement Every time the Gospel is read at Mass the saving mysteries of Jesus Christ are made present to all who hear His words Though the Book of the Gospels has not changed we have recently acquired a new tabor with matching candlesticks for use during Eucharistic Adoration The tabor is the stand on which the monstrance is placed upon the altar its name drawn from Mount Tabor the site of Christ's Transfiguration Just as the Lord was revealed in glory on the mountaintop so the tabor helps lift up and visibly honor the glory of our Eucharistic Lord during adoration Previously we had been using a wooden plant stand originally meant for decorating the high altar Because its surface was smaller than the base of the monstrance placing the monstrance on it always felt a bit awkward and unsteady The new tabor offers a much more secure foundation and is adorned with beautiful metalwork designed to draw eyes upward helping to focus our sight in adoration of our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament Parish Council Nominations Nominations for the Parish Council should be returned no later than Monday June 30th Nomination sheets are available in the narthex and can be
