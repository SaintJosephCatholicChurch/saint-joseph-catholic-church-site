NOVEMBER 12 2017 YR From the Pastors Desk WISDOM IS NECESSARY IN ALL THINGS WE DO IN LIFE My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all The book of Wisdom is one of the seven books that are not in the Protestant Bible Thus we have 46 books in the Old Testament while our separated brethren have 39 books These 7 books do not have their original language in Hebrew So Marti Luther removed them in com piling the Protestant Bible just to make a difference Thus the original language of the book of Wisdom was in Greek written by a Jew living in Alexandria in Egypt Wis dom is personified a literary device used often in all literatures of the world Wisdom which incorporates that mysterious dimension called faith Wisdom is a gift of God She Wisdom makes her own rounds seeking those who are worthy of her It is the first of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit We need her to survive and to be saved There are 5 senses we know Senses of Touch Taste sight hearing and smell But there is another one the sixth sense Which is that one It is called Common Sense and that common sense is WISDOM Without it nothing goes well We need it so much for it is indispensable in life That is why it is a gift from God God gives her to everyone But some people do not want to make use of her Without her there will be trouble and confusion and chaotic situation everywhere In the 1st Reading just hear Wis 61216 The book says about Wisdom she is readily perceived by those who love her and found by those who seek her She has tens to make herself known in anticipation of their desire whoever watches for her at dawn shall not be disappointed If you seek her you will find her sitting by your gate My dear brothers and sisters in Christ Wisdom is indispensable in life In the 2nd Reading 1 Thes 41318St Paul was telling us that those who have died are in peace We should not weep like those who have no hope It is Wisdom that will help us to see the reality dead with the eye of faith and pierce the mystery and fear of death with wisdom and comprehend it with hope and love Wisdom helps us to realize that death is neither the destruction of the human person nor the annihilation of the hu man life but rather a transition into glory For if we believe that Jesus died and rose so too will God through Jesus will bring with him those who have fallen asleep Therefore console one another with these words Yes the dead will rise into glory in the Lord Jesus Christ Then in the Gospel Mt 2442a44 The parable of the ten virgins shows us the significant role of Wisdom The wise and the unwisefoolish virgins to which group do you see yourself The 5 wise virgins filled their lamps with oil and took extra bottles of oil for their lamps While the other 5 unwise foolishly virgins brought no extra bottles of oil They must face the consequences of their unwise choice It deprived then the entrance into the wedding hall So will the unwise who continuously postpone their seriousness in working for and walking towards heaven will miss the Kingdom of God So be wise and act wisely The Kingdom of Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it Please do something now so that you can enter it God bless you NB 1 We plan for Pilgrimage to the Holy Land to join in the Foot Steps of Jesus Christ It is from April 23 to May 2 2018 Thanks to <a
