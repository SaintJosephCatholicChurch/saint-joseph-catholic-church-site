SACRAMENT THE EMMAUS EPISOD My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all I want to congratulate all those who will be making their First Holy Commun ion next weekend Sunday May 7 2017 at 10:00am Mass They are Kolby Buckley Ellie Coyne and Savannah Kinsey I will hear their 2nd Confessions after 7:30am Mass today April 30 2017 Thanks to their parents sponsors who stood by them Thanks also to their Religious Education teachers and others who helped and prepared them very well It was wonderful I want to thank the DRE Michelle Paxton and all Catechists for their devotedness in Religious Education Classes which ends today Sunday God bless you In the celebration of the Holy Mass we have two major parts The Liturgy of the Word or the Table of the word and the Liturgy of the Holy Eucharist or the Table of the Holy Eucharist words and signSacrament Both are important to bring out the reality we celebrate We grow in faith through the ministry of word that is in reading our bible listening attentively to homilies and their explanation and the celebration of the Eucha rist our Passover meal In them we discover Christ the Lord and be saved Faith comes by hearing that is why it is important that we need to read the Bible read Catholic books and other good books and attend Mass and listen to homilies That is why St Peter in the 1st Reading Acts 214 2233 stated strongly thus You who are Jews indeed all of you staying in Jerusalem Let this be known to you and listen to my word He explained to them that Christ is the fulfillment of the promise God made to David their ancestor and that all that David wrote about the Messiah the Christ were all seen and manifested in Christ Jesus In the Gospel Lk 241335 the episode of Jesus and the two of his disciples travelling to Emmaus brought clearly the tow important parts of the Holy Mass The Lord Jesus spoke the word to them teaching them from the Scripture and they listened attentively So they said Were not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us on the way and opened the Scriptures to us And at table they came to recognize Jesus in the breaking of the bread the Holy Eucharist Thus we are nourished from the table of the Word and the table of the Holy Eucharist Word and signSacrament It is through these that we shall discover the risen Lord Jesus Christ and thus be saved Let us always recognize Our Lord Jesus at the Eucharistic celebration God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something SCRIPTUREMASS
