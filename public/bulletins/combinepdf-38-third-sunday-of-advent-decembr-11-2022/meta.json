  "text": "Third Sunday of Advent December 11 2022 This weekend December 10th 11th the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Advent or Gaudete Sunday This Sunday has had the name of Gaudete given to it from the first word of the Introit Entrance Antiphon Rejoice in the Lord always again I say rejoice Indeed the Lord is near We are called to Rejoice as we are at the half way point of Advent and the Lord though not yet here is nearer than before This moment of joyous expectation is reflected in various ways throughout our liturgy Most noticeably the chasuble chalice veil burse and Advent candle are all rose colored mixing the colors of penitential violet with joyous gold The sanctuary which was previously fairly sparse is adorned with greater decoration this weekend Though we will return to our more austere practices tomorrow let us with the Church be glad today as we keep in mind that our Lord is now so near unto us This coming Saturday December 17th the Church will change her focus from the coming of Christ at the end of time to His coming on Christmas Day On Saturday we will begin the recitation of the Antiphons which are included on this weekend's cover during Vespers or Evening Prayer Dating back to at least the 8th Century each antiphon represents an Old Testament messianic prophecy that is brought to fulfillment in Jesus Christ In our modern day these antiphons are perhaps most recognizable from the lyrics of Come Come Emmanuel The repeated use of Come crescendoing with each verse is meant to emphasize our intense longing and growing desire for Jesus Christ In the same way these four weeks of Advent preparation are meant to awaken us from slumber stoke the flames of our hearts and render us worthy to receive the Christ child on Christmas Day and every day Advent Special Events With these last two weeks of Advent we still have a number of offerings coming up Join us this Wednesday evening December 14th as we welcome Fort Wayne based praise group Shema Culture to lead our evening Holy Hour from 600 7:00PM On Thursday December 15th come learn about Lectio Divina an ancient meditative approach to praying the Sacred Scriptures in the Parish Social Hall
