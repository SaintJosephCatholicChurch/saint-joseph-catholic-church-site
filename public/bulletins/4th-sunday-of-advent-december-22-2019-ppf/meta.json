213151923 FOURTH SUNDAY OF ADVENT December 22 2019 As we enter into these last few days of the Advent season our joy becomes palpable This time of preparation is about to give way to the advent of Jesus Christ to the world on Christmas Day As the St Luke reveals in our Gospel today Jesus is Emmanuel or God is with us He comes into the world and into our lives to bring His peace and joy May we use these next two days to continue our preparation preparing for the coming of the Christ child Jesus has come into the world for us so that we might have eternal life He remains with us every step of the way and challenges us to become the Saints we have been called to be As we are just preparing to enter into the Christmas season it may feel that it has already passed us by Our secular and consumerist world has already shifted its focus to the next coming holiday even though Christmas Day is not yet here And when it does arrive we are only beginning the Christmas season or Christmastide Our Christmas celebrations will continue throughout the twelve days of Christmas which brings us to the Epiphany or the coming of the Magi Even then Christmastide goes even further ending only in the Baptism of the Lord the following weekend May we continue our celebration of this glorious day throughout all of Christmastide for we celebrate not just a holiday but one of the holiest days of our liturgical year as the Word was made flesh John 114 and salvation entered the world Throughout Christmastide we also celebrate many beautiful feast days including St Stephen St John the Evangelist the Holy Innocents and the Holy Family I invite you to join us throughout the next week in these liturgical celebrations at daily Mass Parish Updates Our interior lighting project completing the conversion of the lighting in the Sanctuary to LED fixtures is facing an unexpected delay and will not be able to be completed until after the New Year For the time being we have been able to redirect several of the exterior Sanctuary spotlights to illuminate the front of the Sanctuary near the Tabernacle I apologize for these delays and thank you for your patience as we work to bring this project to completion After our inaugural Young Adult Social this past weekend we will add this group as a regular monthly gathering to our parish schedule in the New Year Starting in January our parish Young Adult Group will meet every third Sunday of the month from 5:00PM to 6:00PM These gatherings offer a great chance to help build and strengthen community within our parish family Reminder Our Knights of Columbus meet every first Tuesday at 7:00PM in the Parish Social Hall and our St Joseph Womens Group meet every second Tuesday at 7:00PM in the Parish Conference Room New members are always welcome On Thursday January 9th we will offer a Teaching Mass in the Church from 530 6:30PM This is being offered as a part of our Rite of Christian Initiations for Adults RCIA Sessions and all are invited to join us to learn more about the Mass Note Teaching Mass is not an actual Mass Our daily Mass that day will be offered at its normal time 8:00AM Instead a Teaching Mass is a chance for us to walkthrough ask questions about and explain the various parts of the Mass in a more indepth manner Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF DECEMBER 2829 2019 CANTORS 500 Marita Crawfis 730 Mike
