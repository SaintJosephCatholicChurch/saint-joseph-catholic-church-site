Sunday of Lent February 22 2026 Passing of Fr Bill Sullivan It is with great sadness that we share the news of the passing of Fr Bill Sullivan who peacefully entered into his eternal reward this past Thursday surrounded by his loving family Please keep the repose of the soul of Fr Bill in your prayers asking the Lord to grant him eternal rest and pray also for the consolation of his family his brother priests and the many parish families he faithfully served in over 50 years of priestly ministry Following his retirement in June of 2021 Fr Bill became a regular presence and generous helper to our parish He made it a personal priority to be with us each week often concelebrating our daily Mass at least once a week and was always the first to offer his help with both weekend and daily Masses and confessions whenever I was scheduled to be away from the parish As I've shared before Fr Bill was my childhood pastor at St Thomas in Elkhart That had made these past few years with him at our parish especially meaningful to me I am deeply grateful not only for his priestly ministry in my childhood which is one of the reasons that I am a priest today but also for the wonderful opportunity that we've had to grow together in priestly fraternity these past few years Needless to say he will be terribly missed Visitation will be held at St John the Baptist Catholic Church on Fairfield Avenue on Tuesday February 24th from 300 7:00PM with a Rosary and vigil service starting at 6:30PM Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at St John the Baptist Catholic Church on Fairfield Avenue on Wednesday February 25th at 11:00AM with visitation one hour before Bishop Kevin Rhoades officiating Burial will follow at Catholic Cemetery in Fort Wayne Renovation Updates Hearing Assistance and Flooring This past week we've had some great progress moving forward in our renovations Bluffton based Stylus Technologies installed an induction hearing loop in the nave This system generates a magnetic signal that connects hearing aids and cochlear implants equipped with telecoils directly to our sound system It works with all telecoil coil enabled devices and helps eliminate echo and background noise for those who rely on hearing assistance The terrazzo flooring continues to move forward in the church At this point approximately 80 of the floor has been poured We are currently at a brief pause as we await the arrival of the medallions for the central aisle These medallions are being precision cut by water jet from solid aluminum blocks and are expected to arrive by March 10th In the meantime the sections already poured are being ground down in preparation for final polishing If you would like to preview the finished look I encourage you to stop by the shadow boxes located outside the Daily Mass Chapel Samples of our selected terrazzo colors have been placed there to help visualize the completed floor Once the terrazzo installation and polishing are finished the pews will be returned and set in the nave allowing us to resume weekend liturgies inside the Church currently predicted around the beginning of April Estate and Funeral Planning
