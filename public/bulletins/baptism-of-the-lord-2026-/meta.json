Baptism of the Lord January 11 2026 This weekend January 10th 11th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Baptism of the Lord This day both marks the close of the Christmas Season and brings us into the First Week of Ordinary Time Though there is a brief resurgence of Christmas joy on the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord marking the fortieth day since Christmas we remain in Ordinary Time until the beginning of the Lenten Season on Ash Wednesday This transition to Ordinary Time should not however simply be seen as filler between our liturgical seasons Moving into this season is not a step down from something more important Instead it is a step forward into the ordered life of the Church where growth takes precedence over spectacle Vestments and liturgical coverings transition to green a color expressing continuity stability and the quiet endurance of life sustained by the Spirit Green is the natural color for this spiritual work Growth in nature is rarely dramatic It happens gradually almost imperceptibly Holiness follows the same pattern If Christmas and Epiphany reveal who Christ is and Easter reveals what He has accomplished then the green of Ordinary Time is where this revelation is lived It is the color of a field under daily light growing toward harvesttime not by quick spectacle but by enduring faithfulness The term Ordinary Time itself is often misunderstood It does not mean plain or insignificant It comes from the word ordinal referring to numbered weeks These counted weeks provide structure and rhythm to the Church year Without the intensity of a penitential season or the brilliance of a high feast Ordinary Time gives space for the Gospel to be absorbed slowly through repetition and habit and take root in the heart General Update Parish Directory As an update on our parish directory we are still working with Universal Church Directory in bringing this project to completion When the two teams of photographers were with us earlier this year they had taken a number of photographs of our campus for use in the directory At the moment we are waiting on the staff from Universal Church Directory to provide the full set of campus photographs which we can choose from for the directory Once these photographs have been selected we will be able to submit all of the needed paperwork to move into the production of the directory As a reminder each parish family who had a photograph taken or provided their own photograph for the directory will receive a copy of the directory at no cost Additional copies will be available for purchase in the Parish Office General Update Parish Renovations After initial planning meetings this past Monday Shawnee Construction kicked off our renovation work at 7 AM this past Tuesday These initial weeks are slated as demolition time starting with the removal of any remaining carpet tile and glue to reveal the underlying concrete flooring in the Church This will prepare the way for both the installation of a loop induction hearing system and laying the design work for the terrazzo flooring Thank you again for your patience and understanding as the renovations are underway With both the holy day and last weekend under our belts we have seemingly transitioned very naturally into our temporary worship spaces Thanks to the generosity of several parishioners we've been able to add an additional fifty five chairs into the Social Hall increasing out seating capacity for our weekend liturgies to 180 I won't complain if we try to exceed that Our Conference Room Chapel is able to seat up to forty for our weekday Masses and weekly times of adoration I encourage you if able to join us for these weekday times of Mass and prayer Just as the Church space is being worked upon so we should give the Lord a chance to work upon our hearts This time of parish renovation is not only about restoring a sacred space but about renewing the living temple of faith that gathers within it Saturday January 10 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Evelyn Dale Morrissey Sunday January 11 7:10am Rosary 7:30am Our Parish Family 9:40am Rosary 10:00am Tom Cincotta
