Obligation as we celebrate the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary On this day the Church celebrates Mary the Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ being taken up body and soul into heaven This ancient teaching of Christs Church prefigured in both Enoch Gen 524 He brews 115 and Elijah 2 Kings 211 sees Gods work in Mary brought to completion here on earth as she is brought into eternity It is a day worth celebrating as it gives us joyful hope that we too may follow Marys path that points us always to her Son Jesus and to His Heav enly Kingdom Mass Times for the Holy Day Vigil Mass on Wednesday August 14th at 7:00PM Mass on Thursday August 15th at both 7 AM and 5:30PM As we approach a new academic year may we keep in our prayers our many students that are preparing to
