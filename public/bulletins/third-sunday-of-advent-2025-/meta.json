Sunday of Advent December 14 2025 Thank you to all those who participated in our Forty Hours Devotion and Consecration to St Joseph this past week May this time given to the Lord bear tremendous fruit in both our lives and the life of our parish This weekend Dec 13th 14th the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Advent also known as Gaudete Sunday or Rejoice Sunday This name comes from the beginning of the Entrance Antiphon for today's Mass Rejoice in the Lord always again I say rejoice Philippians 44 This brief moment of joy during a penitential season marks the halfway point of Advent and emphasizes that the One we await is already drawing near The expectant and hope filled joy of this day is reflected in the rose colored vestments worn by the priest and the rose Advent candle both of which mix the penitential violet of Advent with the joyful gold of Christmastide We also raise our voices for a recessional hymn today breaking our musical fast for a day's time as a reminder of what silence is meant to prepare us for That glorious day when all God's people shall see together the glory of the Lord On Wednesday Dec 17th the Church will fully change her Advent focus from the second coming of Christ to His coming on Christmas Day as we begin the recitation of the Antiphons The Antiphons are formally recited as a part of Vespers Evening Prayer at the Liturgy of the Hours the daily prayer of the Church Dating back to at least the 6th Century each antiphon is an Old Testament messianic prophecy fulfilled in Jesus Christ By the 8th Century the Antiphons were in regular use throughout Rome It is believed that Benedictine monks were the first to arrange these antiphons with a definite purpose and order Working in reverse order the first letter of each antiphon spells out Latin for Tomorrow I come to you As the Antiphons end on Christmas Eve this phrase anticipates the coming joy of the Christ child on Christmas Day In our modern day these antiphons are recognizable from both the Alleluia verse at daily Mass and the lyrics of Come Come Emmanuel The repeated use of Come crescendo ing with each verse is meant to emphasize our intense longing and desire for the Lord In the same way these four weeks of Advent are meant to awaken us from slumber stoke the flames of our hearts and prepare us to welcome our Savior on Christmas Day Advent Penance Service Dec 17th from 600 7:00PM Our Advent Penance Service is Wednesday December 17th from 600 7:00PM in the Church We will be joined by three priests to hear confessions I would encourage you to welcome the peace that is Jesus Christ by coming to the Sacrament of Confession Here the Lord heals strengthens and reconciles our souls through the power of His forgiveness In this way we prepare our hearts for Christmas Day by giving it over entirely to the Lord Parish Renovations Volunteer Work Days Though Shawnee Construction will formally begin work on our church renovations Monday Jan 5th we will begin
