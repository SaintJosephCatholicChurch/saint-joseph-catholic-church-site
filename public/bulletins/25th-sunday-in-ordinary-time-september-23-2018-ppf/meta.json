112529Jas 516 Mk 93843454748 25th Sunday in Ordinary Time September 23 2018 Year We warmly welcome Fr Louis Fowoyo from the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Fort Wayne as our celebrant this weekend While I am away on pilgrimage Fr Louis will be staying with us in the Rectory throughout this coming week to assist with our daily liturgies and to attend to any emergencies that may arise Know that I will be keeping all of you in my prayers through out this pilgrimage As you may have seen in the news Bishop Rhoades as promised has released the names of all priests from our diocese accused of misconduct with a minor going back several decades It is his hope that this act of transpar ency will serve as a source of healing for the survivors of abuse This list con sisted of 17 priests and 1 deacon none of whom were ever assigned to our parish May we continue our prayers for all survivors of abuse and those af fected in way by these scandals seeking the intercession of both St Monica patroness of abuse victims and St Joseph our patron and the patron of the universal Church As these difficult times continue it is natural for questions to arise To help our parish family give voice to these questions and seek answers I will be facilitating a discussion forum in the coming weeks to discuss these scandals that have recently come to light within the Church More information will fol low soon Last week after Peter affirms Jesus as the Christ Jesus proceeds to predict His passion and death for the first time In our Gospel today Mark 93037 Jesus makes this prediction a second time His disciples who expect the Messiah to establish an earthly kingdom do not yet understand His true mission Though they know the Scriptures including Isaiahs Suffering Ser vant and the suffering predicted for the Just One in our first reading Wisdom 212 1720 they are not yet prepared to accept how these prophecies truly apply to Jesus For this reason they do not understand what He is saying To be able to do so they must first rid themselves of their worldly expectations Jesus places in their midst a child one who has no cultural status or worldly standing Yet this lack of worldly standing in this time period does not dimin ish the true worth and dignity of that child In the same way Jesus as the Mes siah will bring about not an earthly kingdom but a heavenly kingdom They must first be able to accept this so that they are able to accept Him Continuing in this theme our second reading James 31643 speaks of our interior disposition or our passions If we live worrying only for our selves as the worldly calls us to we will find only discord and strife But if we are able to live for one another the Golden Rule we find the fruits of the Holy Spirit alive in our lives In living for one another we live for Jesus Christ Like the disciples after the Resurrection when they finally understand the Lord we see the joy of relationship and ultimately union with God To give up the worldly and instead to live for the heavenly How can we live more fully for Jesus Christ and His heavenly kingdom today In Christ Fr David Hope has two beautiful daughters their names are Anger and Courage Anger at the way things are and Courage to see that they do not remain as they are Saint Agustine WEEKEND OF September 2930 2018 CANTORS 500 TBA 730 Donna
