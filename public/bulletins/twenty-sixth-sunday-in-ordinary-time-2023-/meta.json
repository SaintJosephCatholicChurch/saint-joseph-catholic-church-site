Margaret Pogue and Richard Payne Twenty Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time October 1 2023 This weekend September 30th October 1st the Church celebrates the Twenty sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time As we continue to pray through the Gospel of St Matthew we have transitioned from his fourth discourse on Church Order into his fifth narrative Within the narrative we continue to be taught in parables but will see that these parables which were addressed to His disciples are for the next month now addressed to the chief priests and the elders of the people Intermixed between these parables we find our Lord engaged in a series of controversies with the Jewish religious leaders This narrative culminates in Jesus denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees and His lament over Jerusalem It then transitions into the fifth and final discourse of the Gospel as Jesus predicts the destruction of the temple and His final coming These predictions will be matched with parables extolling us to live in readiness for these times Liturgically we still have eight weeks of Ordinary Time left The parables we are hearing will ultimately bring us to the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe at the end of the liturgical year Though it is still far away this solemnity can still be seen off in the distance We should not hear our readings over these next many weekends without keeping in mind the truth born by this solemnity Jesus Christ is King He is our King He is King of all the universe This truth has a deep meaning Our personal relationship with Jesus cannot remain only within ourselves Instead it is to be lived out everyday reflected in how we treat one another Every one of us are united as subjects to the one King Ongoing Parish Projects and Beyond You most likely noticed some of the construction work being done on the campus over the past two weekends If everything comes together you should be greeted next weekend by a new slab of concrete alongside our handicap parking in the parking lot Once the concrete is set we will move forward with installing the old church bell and our two new flag poles special Thank You to parishioners Andy and Clayton Vachon and Rick Singer for their work to help guide this project to completion As previously mentioned with both this project and the altar at the cemetery nearing completion we are now in a place to begin moving forward with our upcoming Church renovations Our first step in this project involves consulting with a church architect for a professional opinion of what is needed and what can be done In addition to updates in flooring and painting a noticeable need very evident at our 10 AM Mass will be to consider ways to increase our seating capacity as our parish family continues to grow Earlier this week I contacted Bill Heyer of William Heyer Architect out of Columbus Ohio Bill is a church architect who comes highly recommended by our diocesan offices Within Fort Wayne alone some of his recent work includes the renovation at St Charles and the building of both the St Mary Magdalene Oratory at St Vincent de Paul and the St Francis Oratory at the University of St Francis He is also currently consulting with St Rose of Lima in nearby Monroeville for their renovations Having spoken previously with Bill he had the opportunity to visit our parish last year to see the Church and meet with some of our staff and parishioners I look forward to starting our conversations with him to learn what possibilities there are open for our parish to consider Once this process begins we will open conversations for input and feedback As this will be the first major renovation of the Church in many years I hope you are as excited as I am and invite your prayers throughout this entire process Parish Office Hours Month of October With Michelle out of the office this month please see the altered Parish Office Hours listed on the next page of the bulletin special Thank You to those
