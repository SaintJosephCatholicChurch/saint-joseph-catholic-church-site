10 2023 This weekend Dec 9th 10th the Church celebrates the Second Sunday of Advent Our Gospel reading this weekend is always focused on St John the Baptist and his call to repentance To understand the importance of this call we must first understand who St John is He is often considered to be both the last and greatest prophet of the Old Testament Our Lord Himself says that no one born of woman was greater than St John Matthew 1111St John the Baptist serves in a truly unique role as the immediate precursor to the Savior of the World In this way he bridges together both the Old and New Testaments He is also among the first to recognize the Savior Himself both in action and in word When the Blessed Mother visited Elizabeth John leaped in his mother's womb Luke 141 Similarly he calls Jesus the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world along the Jordan John 129St John the Baptist lived a life that embraced prayer poverty simplicity and penitential practices Throughout his ministry he preached from the desert of Judea Despite this people still came to him including many Pharisees and Sadducees As people came to him he preached bold words to all as he called all people to repentance He went on to preach that someone much mightier than he was coming after him who would become the source of salvation Though much more could be said about St John the Baptist it's essential that we regularly consider the words that he preaches today His message of repentance is one that is meant to shake us to the core From it we must ask ourselves this question In what ways do I need to hear St John's message of repentance today This question is a reminder that we are called to daily death to self and conversion which open us up to a deeper relationship with Jesus Christmas Mass Schedule It is worth note that this year Advent is the shortest that it can ever be After our morning Masses for the Fourth Sunday of Advent we will enter into our celebrations for the Vigil Masses of Christmas later that same afternoon This means that we have the obligation and opportunity to assist at Mass twice once to fulfill our Sunday obligation and the other our Christmas obligation To help you in planning for these upcoming dates please see our bulletin cover this weekend with a helpful table of all of our Mass times Similar to past years each of our Christmas Masses has a certain uniqueness to it At our 4 PM Christmas Vigil Mass we will bless our parish Nativity scene be joined by our Children's Choir and welcome Fr Bill Sullivan as our homilist At 5:30PM our Adult Choir invites us to join in singing Christmas Carols that will lead us into our 6 PM Christmas Vigil Mass Our Midnight Mass 12:00AM will be celebrated by candlelight And finally our 9 AM Christmas Day Mass will be followed by brunch sign up in the narthex As always we are planning and preparing to welcome a number of guests to our Christmas liturgies If you see anyone that you do not recognize please welcome them to the parish If you know of anyone who has no where to go please invite them to join us And if you know what Mass time you will be attending please consider signing up as a Greeter to welcome our guests and share with them the joy of Christmas and the Christ child The Christmas Season Not Just One Day Part of the joy of preparing for Christmas through Advent is recognizing that Christmas isn't just one day but a whole season As captured by The Twelve Days of Christmas the Christmas Season continues throughout the celebration of the Epiphany There is even historic precedent to continue our Christmas celebration for forty days through the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord or Candlemas Let us not end our Christmas celebrations on Christmas Day even as our secular culture moves on Instead let us prepare to continue our celebration and prayerfully spend time unwrapping the many gifts of grace that the Lord gives to us over the coming days In
