First Sunday of Advent Jer 3314 16 Ps 254 5 8 10 14 1 Thes 312 42 Lk 2125 28 34 36 Our Lord Jesus Christ King of the Universe November 24 2024 The term Eucharist originates from the Greek word eucharistia meaning thanksgiving What better way than to begin our Thanksgiving celebrations then to join together in giving thanks to God at Mass Join us for a special Thanksgiving Day Mass this Thursday Nov 28th at 9 AM This weekend November 23rd 24th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe This solemnity marks the end of our liturgical year as we prepare to enter into a new year of God's grace with the beginning of Advent next weekend The liturgical year is meant to be like a whole catechesis of the Christian faith taking us from the birth of Christ and His baptism to His final anointing death and resurrection Just as the liturgical year is a catechesis of our Faith so it is meant to be a mirror of our lives we who are called to be imitators of Christ Eph 51 2 In this way by ending the liturgical year with the Solemnity of Christ the King we are reminded that our own lives are meant to end in Christ as well For at the end of this earthly life we will find ourselves before Christ the King He who will pass His final judgment on all that has been done in this life Though the end of the liturgical year and the first two weeks of Advent focus our attention on the end of time and the final judgment this Solemnity of Christ the King also directs our hearts and minds toward the present reality of His reign As we reflect on His kingship we are called to acknowledge Him as the true ruler of our lives not just in the future but in the here and now This solemnity challenges us to examine how we are living our lives under the kingship of Christ Are we allowing His teachings to shape our actions Are we serving others as He has served us in humility and sacrificial love Christ the King invites us to a deeper relationship with Him a relationship that transforms our hearts and calls us to be His witnesses to the world Let us renew our commitment today to live anew under the reign of Christ Forty Hours Devotion As a reminder our Forty Hours Devotion is quickly approaching One way that we express our devotion to the reign of Christ the King is by giving to Him so freely of our time I would strongly encourage each of us to sign up for an hour of adoration throughout the Forty Hours If you have never had the opportunity to spend time in adoration now is the time You will be amazed at how the Lord will speak to you in the quiet of your heart if you but make this time for Him Liturgy of the Eucharist to the Concluding Rite With the Concluding Rite it seems that we're practically at the end of the Mass closing prayer from the Priest a closing hymn and Mass is over Not quite The Concluding Rite is so much more than just the ending of Mass In fact it is not the end but only the beginning The Concluding Rite is truly a sending forth of the Body of Christ us back into the world We can consider the Concluding Rite as a blessing for our journey ahead stepping out of the Church the sacred and entering back into the world the secular During Ordinary Time this rite is fairly simple During special seasons it may be done with more solemnity including offering a three fold blessing as we bow our heads and pray for God's blessing The Concluding Rite then ends as the Mass itself begins With the sign of the cross The Concluding Rite literally dismisses us from Mass But more than that we are sent forth on mission by the priest What we have just heard and experienced in this hour we must now in turn do for the world which is to become the bread of life and cup of blessing for others Whenever we leave the church building after Mass we know that our mission has begun As Jesus commanded so succinctly to His disciples He says again to us too Go forth into all the world and preach the gospel to all nations Let us go forth rejoicing in the Lord Faithfully in Christ Fr David Weekend of November 30th December 1st 500 Teresa Smith 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Adult Choir 500 Stacey Coulardot 730 Sarah McCorkle 1000
