Jesus Mary and Joseph This celebration though with roots in the 17th Century was only added to our universal liturgical calendar in 1921 Following the devastation of the First World War it was the hope of Pope Benedict XV that devotion to the Holy Family would lead to a renewal of both familial and societal life This feast seeks to portray the Holy Family of Nazareth as the model of family life from which our own families can draw inspiration and find help As we celebrated just a few days ago our Lord did not enter this world alone He came through the way of the family And in this way family life has been sanctified May we place our families under the protection of the Holy Family entrusting ourselves into the loving embrace of Jesus Mary and Joseph Solemnity of Mary Mother of God Holy Day of Obligation On Monday January 1st the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Mary Mother of God This ancient celebration traces itself back to at least the 5th Century At the Council of Ephesus in AD 431 Mary was recognized as Theotokos or God bearer by the Church This title of the Blessed Mother emphasizes that Jesus is true God and true man As with all things the Blessed Mother always points us right back to her Son Jesus Christ The Solemnity of Mary Mother of God is a Holy Day of Obligation To help ensure that we have the opportunity to meet our obligation of assisting at Mass on this day we will have Masses for the Holy Day as follows Tuesday Dec 31st Vigil Mass 5:00PM Wednesday Jan 1st Mass 7:30AM and 10:00AM Living with the Saints in the New Year As we gather to celebrate the coming Holy Day and New Year we will continue our parish tradition of choosing a Saint to spend the coming year with As we know however in the wise and loving plan of Jesus Christ it is not we who choose the Saint but the Saints who chooses us As we have so many friends in Heaven should we not strive each year to learn a little more about them and grow closer in relationship with them You can find a basket in the narthex with little strips of paper each with a Saint's name and a little biographical information for you to choose from This practice first started by Saint Faustina Kowalska of the Divine Mercy apparition among the Sisters in her convent invites us to spend the year learning about our Saint both historically and spiritually By inviting these Saints into our lives they become intercessors on our behalf before the Lord James 517 amid the coming New Year The Twelve Days of Christmas and Christmastide Our bulletin cover highlights the ongoing Twelve Days of Christmas which reference the time from Christmas Day to the Epiphany Throughout these days we are reminded that our Christmas celebration is not meant to last only for one day but for an entire season In fact our celebrations continue for at least two more weeks as we celebrate the Epiphany next weekend and the Baptism of the Lord the following weekend Let us continue to rejoice in the good news proclaimed by the angels so long ago Savior has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord Luke 211 special Thank You to all those who have helped make this Christmas season so beautiful Our Choir Children's Choir cantors and musicians put much effort and practice into ensuring that our Masses were accompanied with beautiful music Our Decorating Committee transformed the Church beautifully for the Christmas season Our Parish Office and Parish Staff were as always an invaluable assistance to me throughout both the Advent season and into the Christmas season Thank You again to the many hands that helped
