OF EASTER MAY 19 2019 special Congratulations again to our ten First Holy Communicants and our seven Confirmandi As a priest I have celebrated several Masses of First Holy Communion in various parishes and have concelebrated many Confirmations with the Bishop This is however my first year doing so as a pastor I cannot put into words the great joy that my soul experiences to see our young people my spiritual children come forward to receive these Sacraments It is my deepest prayer that in these Sacraments our young parishion ers may be strengthened by Gods grace and always know of His love for them May we as their parish family pray for them everyday and do everything in our power to be wit nesses to the love of Jesus Christ in their lives This coming June we will add an additional time of adoration and confession to our weekly parish schedule Starting Wednesday June 5th we will have simple exposition and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament one hour prior 600 6:55pm to the Wednesday evening 7:00pm Mass During this time of adoration a priest will be available to hear confessions 600 6:50pm This time of adoration and confession will be offered every Wednesday evening This addition to our schedule will be reflected in the weekly parish schedule as listed in the bulletin Note On the 2nd Wednesdays of the month we will con tinue with our parish practice of extended adoration from 500 7:00pm leading into the Wednesday evening 7:00pm Mass The Litany of the Eucharist and Benediction will start at 6:45pm During this time a priest will be available to hear confessions 600 6:45pm As we near the summer months I invite you to spend more and more time in prayer With these extended periods of adoration we have the opportunity as St Clare of Assisi wrote in the 13th Century to gaze upon Him consider Him contemplate Him as we desire to imitate Him Time spent with our Lord is never wasted Quite the opposite is true When we make time for God in our day we will see that we approach the rest of the day in a whole new way Our Church thanks to our new security system continues to remain open at all hours as a place for prayer and quiet contemplation Mass is offered every day often with the recitation of the Rosary following Mass Let us do everything we can this summer to grow in our spiritual life and deepen our personal relationship with the Lord through the Sacraments He Himself has given to us through His Church As we approach the summer months Bishop Rhoades has shared with me which priests will be assisting here at St Josephs during my twomonth absence For the month of June we will welcome Fr Silvino Ndayambaje from the Cathedral in Fort Wayne Fr Silvino a priest of the Diocese of Fort Portal in Uganda has assisted at a variety of par ishes in our diocese for the past several years Some may already know him from his time as an associate pastor at Sts Peter and Paul in Huntington Ive had the chance this past week to meet with Fr Silvino and to show him around our parish campus He is looking forward to being here with you the entirety of June and the first week in July For the month of July we will welcome Fr Tommy Lane from the Diocese of Cloyne in County Cork Ireland Fr Tommy has for the past fifteen years served as Pro fessor of Sacred Scripture at Mount St Marys Seminary in Emmitsburg MD As Mount St Marys is the

spend a few days with us here at St Josephs at the beginning of Holy Week and is looking forward to being here with you in July I thank each and everyone of you for the warm welcome that you will show Fr Silvino and Fr Tommy that same warm welcome that I received when I first arrived here so many months ago Theyve have already heard from me repeatedly at how wonderful and hospitable our parish is
