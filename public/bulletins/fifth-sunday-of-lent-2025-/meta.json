April 6 2025 This weekend April 5th 6th the Church celebrates the Fifth Sunday of Lent At this moment in the liturgical year we are participating in the great richness of many varying traditions Continuing with the ancient practice of the Scrutinies dating back to the 4th Century we will hear one last time from the readings for Year united with the Scrutinies since the 7th Century to help prepare our Elect who are entering the Church at the Easter Vigil In addition to the Scrutinies we are also entering into Passiontide marking the last two weeks of Lent This time is most notably recognized by veiling the statues within the Church This practice itself dates back to at least the 9th Century and emphasizes that our Lenten fasting is meant to grow even more rigorous as we near Holy Week As such we fast even from devotional images as our eyes are at this moment meant to be fixed on Christ alone As with all things liturgical the practices of these next two weeks are deeply incarnational engaging not only our spirits but our whole selves body and soul The visual fast of veiled statues stirs our senses to anticipate the glory of the Resurrection Next weekend we physically enter into the mystery of Palm Sunday by joining together in procession to the Church With palm branches held high we walk as the crowds first did in Jerusalem to welcome the Christ The Palm Sunday Procession enters us into Holy Week As described by St John Chrysostom in the 4th Century this week is truly called holy because of the great mysteries which it celebrates Included in this weekend's bulletin is our coming schedule for Holy Week I encourage you to dedicate as much time as possible to prayer throughout these coming weeks most especially during the Sacred Paschal Triduum Palm Sunday Procession April 13th at the 10 AM Mass Next weekend we will celebrate the blessing of palms at every Mass At the 5 PM and 7:30AM Masses we will begin from the back of the Church for the blessing of palms At the 10 Mass however we will begin outside of the Parish Offices and join together in a procession into the Church as we commemorate the Lord's entrance into Jerusalem In case of rain we will move the procession inside to the hallway along the Parish Offices Informational Session Sunday April 6th at 6 PM Don't forget to join us this evening Sunday April 6th at 6 PM in the Church for a presentation by Bill Heyer of William Heyer Architecture Bill and his team have served as the primary architects that we have been working with over the past year to help visualize the possibilities for our eventual parish renovations As a part of that visualization new colorized renderings are now available for your viewing in the narthex The evening will begin with a brief introduction followed by a presentation that will highlight the underlying principles and theology that encompasses the architectural design of a church as the house of God on earth Starting from this general viewpoint we are invited into the creative process as we learn how a church architect takes these underlying principles and transforms them into the brick and mortar stone and glass that we see in a church Moving from this foundation we will then look to our proposed renovations which are meant to build upon and further highlight that beauty which is already inherent within our church itself Following this presentation we will then have an opportunity for a QA Session over all that has been presented We look forward to having as many parishioners join us as possible as we continue this long awaited process regarding renovations As previously mentioned our time table for actually moving forward with any renovations is still uncertain While I had hoped that we would be able to move forward with some work this summer we're still well in the middle of the diocesan process on this end Before we move forward we still need approval from several diocesan committees As we await word from these committees however we will continue to plan and prepare as best as possible Weekend of April 12th 13th Palm Sunday 500 Dan Lautzenheiser 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Adult Choir 500 Stacey

Supper in the Parish Social Hall from 600 6:45PM St Joseph briefly operated a parish schoolhouse In 1894 a schoolhouse was opened for one year This was previously attested to by parishioners in the 1940s who remembered attending the school as children There are also remnants of old prayer cards from the end of the 19th Century praying for the success of St Joseph's School Though the school did not remain open families would begin to send their children to St Aloysius School in nearby Sheldon for sacramental prep and education Knights of Columbus Father Aloysius Phillips Council 7555 Saint
