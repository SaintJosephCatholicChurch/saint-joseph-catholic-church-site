Gary Cook Michael Green and George Bitzer PALM SUNDAY THE PASSION OF THE LORD APRIL 9 2017 HOLY WEEK BEGINS THE 6TH SUNDAY OF LENT Today is Palm Sunday and we begin the Holy Week The Holy Week reminds us of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ the huge price He paid for our salvation It leads us to know that the suffering the death and the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ are together they form one episode They were and should be seen as the exe cution of Gods saving plan It is victory over sin and death Let us accompany the Lord Jesus to Jerusalem and to his eventually journey to Calvary to save mankind from eternal damnation and then rise with Him into glory with glorified bodies Today we celebrate the triumphant entry of the Lord Jesus into his own city Jerusalem as the King to complete his mission and work as our Messiah and Redeemer He entered Jerusalem to suffer die and rise from death into glory His suffering and death are not a defeat but victory over sin and death He humbled himself because of his love for us For us he did not shield his face from buffets and spitting saliva and offered his life on the cross What of your own life How do you see and deal with suffering in your life What do you think when you see your fellow human being die in suffering and distress Do you see the face of Christ in those suffering people Do you see Gods hand in those situa tions Yes we need to see Gods hands in everything that happens to us We are invited to follow the Lord Jesus into the holy city of Jerusalem following Him in the Salvific journey up to the Calvary Hill We are entering a very important and holy week There are 4 groups of people in todays ceremony in the Passion narrative Mt 26142766 or 271154 1 Those who cared loved and followed Jesus 2 Those that hated and contradicted him and wanted to kill him 3 Those who were afraid The wanted to follow Jesus but feared greatly 4 Those that were neither for nor against him To which group do you belong Think about it now What do you tell yourself In my humble opinion my dear brothers and sisters in the Lord let us imitate the first group who cared loved and followed him They spread their garments and branches on the road But let us not spread only our garments but ourselves as best as we can with hu mility Let us spread ourselves like coats under Christs feet and follow him to the Cal vary Let us make sincere effort and avoid renailing him on the cross by our sins Rather let us nail all our bad and rude habits to the cross our gossips envy rivalry murmuring destructive criticisms jealousy cursing scandal provocation anger insinuations telling lies pride black mailing impurities fornication adultery idolatry dishonesty stealing cheating false accusations murder abortion calumny etc Crucify these reject and avoid the Noon Day Devil So rise let us follow Him by attending all the ceremonies in this Holy Week Such as the Chrism Mass at the Cathedral of Immaculate Conception at Fort Wayne by 7:30pm on April 11 2017 Then come here in our Parish for Holy Thursday The Lords Supper on April 13 by 7:00pm Good Friday The Passion of Our Lord by 1:00pm on April 14 The Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday by 9:00pm April 15 Easter Sunday April 16 By 7 30 am or 10:00am These ceremonies form one en tity Do not break them apart for they form One Big Act Faith Our consolation is that God will save us if we believe and accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Re deemer and do our best to be good people Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it God bless you Msgr Pius
