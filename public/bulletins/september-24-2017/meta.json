IS ALWAYS GENEROUS My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all Today Sept 24 is the PLEDGE SUNDAY We shall watch the Bishops Appeal Video Please do you best to participate Let us try to have 100 participation this time We did well last year I hope we will do better this year Thanks in advance for participating and giving generously In todays Liturgy we are assured that God is always compassionate to all us both those who are quick to hear his voice and those who are slow to hear his voice It seems that in our world today material things especially money is much cherished in value Doing something or not doing it seems to depend on the amount of money that goes with it Even what some students choose as their course as their major subject study in schools colleges and univer sities depend on what will be cashed remuneration in money tomorrow However there seem to be some truth in this kind Philosophy and ideology But there is some misconception in this If we apply this ideology to God it would mean that God is owing us something call it sal vation after we have done some good works It is true that the bible speaks of reward but focusing all attention on this aspect alone would result in the immature attitude of a child who thinks that his father owes himher money for every little work heshe does in the house Our main reason for serving God should be love and gratitude and not merely reward for God does not owe us anything no matter what work we do So in the 1st Reading Is 5569 The Israelites in Babylon were felt that their exile was punishment from God for their sins They deserved it But Prophet Isaiah promised them freedom Was the promised freedom due to good works of the people Off course no It was due to Gods generosity For God does not owe anybody anything The 2nd Reading Phil 120c24 27a Was written by Paul to the Philippians when he was in prison in Ephesus the present Turkey It is important that we should take Pauls ad vice and behave like people who are worthy of the Gospel of Christ For if we live we be long to Christ if we die we are his So we should conduct ourselves in a way worthy of the Gospel of Christ for God is always near to those who call upon him says the Psalmist In the Gospel Mt 20116a We realized Gods generosity and love Our reward does not solely depend on our works We need to work do well and be kind to others but our reward does not solely depend on them The laborers who worked for 12 hours received one denarius each but those who worked for one hour only also received one denarius each You can see that their pay does not depend on the amount of work they did It depends on the decision love and generosity of the Landowner Gods ways are not our ways Our duty is to strive to do well and leave reward to God for he is a just God Children and young people listen to your parents serve them and never demand reward for whatever you do for them They know what is good for you and they will do it for you God bless you Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 We are organizing Marriage Encounter Parish Based Please register quickly 2 We are also planning a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land to
