  "text": "First Sunday of Advent November 27 2022 Welcome to all those joining us this holiday weekend and a special welcome home to all of our students joining us over these few days of break I hope that you enjoyed a beautiful celebration of Thanksgiving This weekend November 26th 27th the Church enters into a new liturgical year and celebrates the First Sunday of Advent In this new liturgical year we restart our three year lectionary cycle and will primarily hear from the Gospel of St Matthew Written for a predominantly Jewish and Gentile Christian audience familiar with Jewish customs belief and practices the Gospel of St Matthew places special emphasis on Jesus as the Messiah and how He is the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies With the start of Advent our readings though beginning a new lectionary cycle will continue the apocalyptic theme of the past few weekends This season of Advent is meant to prepare us for the coming of Jesus Christ and for the first half of the season is focused on His second coming at the end of time Known as the Second Advent or the Parousia the second coming of Jesus brings about the general or last judgment This differs from the particular or personal judgment that each of us will face at the moment of our death In our personal judgment our soul will stand before the Lord and be asked that most important question by Truth Himself Do you love Me The answer will be shown by the life we have lived In the final judgment we will be given the chance to see how our lives have affected others for better or for worse In the words of Ven Fulton Sheen For when the curtain goes down on the last day and we respond to the curtain call of judgment we will not be asked what part we played but how well we played the part that was assigned to us This concept of judgment however should not be a thing that causes fear or anxiety For if we live for Him now we do not have to fear His coming again Instead the very thought of the Parousia should enkindle within the Christian soul an eager and burning desire The expectant joy that a child has awaiting Christmas Day is but a slight example of the joy that a Christian should have awaiting Christ For He will come at the end of time not only as the just judge but also as Saviour and Redeemer to those who seek Him out Entering into this Advent season our liturgy is meant to serve as a teaching tool for our lives Our liturgy in every aspect reflects this as being a time of preparation and penance The Advent wreath prominently displayed in the Sanctuary will silently mark the four weeks of our journey towards Christmas Day reflecting the long journey of salvation history to the very birth of Christ The Sanctuary itself will remain fairly sparse with decorations save for Gaudate Sunday to reflect the simplicity to which this season lends itself The Gloria a hymn of praise will not pass our lips again until Christmas Day Our music itself will even be a bit simpler with moments of greater silence which reflects the quieting of our hearts as we contemplate the coming joy of Christmas As a part of our parish's preparation we will also be learning new Mass parts immediately prior to Mass that we will introduce into the liturgy on Christmas Day again emphasizing Advent as a time of preparation On the altar our altar crucifix candlesticks made from precious metals are now replaced with simpler wooden substitutes Our bleached beeswax candles are now unbleached taking on a more somber color All of this to reflect Advent for what it is season of preparation preparing hearts for Christ Additional Confession Time Saturday Mornings In response to increased requests we will be adding an additional weekly time for the Sacrament of Confession Confessions heard every Tuesday 8:30AM to 9:00AM Wednesday 6:00PM to 6:45PM and Saturday 4:00PM to 4:45PM will also now be heard every Saturday morning from 8:30AM to 9:00AM following the 8 AM daily Mass Note
