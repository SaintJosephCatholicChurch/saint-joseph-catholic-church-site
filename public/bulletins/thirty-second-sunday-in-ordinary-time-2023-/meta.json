Congratulation to our All Saints Day Contest Winners 1st St Nicholas Felix 2nd St Therese Katie Jo and 3rd St Philomena Kylie This weekend Nov 11th 12th the Church celebrates the Thirty second Sunday in Ordinary Time As a nation we also celebrate Veterans Day This annual celebration originally known as Armistice Day is a day in which we show our gratitude for those who have defended our country and kept peace throughout the world May we continue to implore the Lord to protect the men and women serving our country and for peace in all places of strife In last weekend's Gospel we heard the Lord's admonishment to call no man father This verse often raises the question of why we as Catholics call priests Father To understand this verse we look at the whole passage and see that our Lord is speaking in hyperbole to His disciples He is cautioning them to avoid the hypocrisy and ultimately pridefulness of the Pharisees Understanding this hyperbole we can then see how St Paul is able to call himself the father of the Corinthians 1 Cor 1228 without contradicting our Lord Catholic priests like St Paul are called Father because we through our ordination share in Jesus spiritual fatherhood This spiritual fatherhood is as real of an identity to the Priest as it to any man who becomes a father in the birth of his first child In this way Father is not a title but an identity Engagement Director Earlier this year we began the search for a part time Engagement Director to assist at the parish This position is meant to help with the organization of events and volunteers and our outreach to our local community As of this past week we are happy to welcome Nick Boratenski into this role for our parish He has quickly stepped into the role taking on several organizational needs for our upcoming Forty Hours Devotion Nick brings a wealth of experience into this position having previously worked in marketing and development for Redeemer Radio and local Helping Hands He and his wife Hannah have served as the heads of our Pro Life Committee this past year and with their children are actively involved in the life of our parish Thank you for your continued prayers that this new position will help us to continue our parish's ongoing growth and outreach Campus Improvements During this past week you may have noticed some work being done near the rectory Alongside the rectory garage which is located on the lower level of the rectory is a high retaining wall few years ago the safety railing run ning along the retaining wall broke apart due to rust and age before falling from the wall Though the area is a low traffic area we have always intended to replace the railing and close off the area as a general safety precaution An opportunity to move forward with this safety project recently came about and was started this past week In addition to a new safety railing that will be placed on the retaining wall a small deck is being added alongside the upper portion of the retaining wall next to the rectory This improvement has the benefit of making the outside area near the rectory more usable while also forming a physical barrier to keep foot traffic away from the retaining wall Outdoor Altar at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery The outdoor altar at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery was set this past Friday special Thank You to the family of late parishioners Wayne Bud and Sharon Miller who have generously donated the outdoor altar in memory of their parents In the coming months a crucifixion scene will be set on the top of the altar with room left for Mass to be offered on the altar special Mass of dedication to bless the new altar will be set for later in the Spring Faithfully in Christ Fr David special Thank You again to Fr Bill Sullivan for offering our Saturday vigil Mass this weekend while I am away on Saturday for a celebration with one of our parish families PARISH CALENDAR Sat Nov 11 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sun Nov 12 Mass
