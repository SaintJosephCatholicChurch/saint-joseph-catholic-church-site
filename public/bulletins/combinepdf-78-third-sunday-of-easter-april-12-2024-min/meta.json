for fifty days it's very easy to become weary of celebrating Yet this liturgical celebration is meant to point ahead as a sign of the eternal joy found in heaven While we celebrate we still do so here and now in the trials of life Let us never forget that these fifty days are simply meant to remind us that we live for something greater Heating AC System Update With the changing weather we will be transitioning our heating system into Spring mode As mentioned during each seasonal shift our heating system has two settings On and Off As the system is serviced this Wednesday by local Dunwiddie Heating we will begin our Spring transition from heating to air conditioning This biannual maintenance also helps to ensure that our systems are working properly and are well maintained for the foreseeable future Blessings of Devotional Items Around this time of year with Confirmations First Holy Communions and graduations upon us I am often asked if I am willing to bless a number of devotional items eg Bibles Rosaries Holy Cards Medals etc that will be given away as gifts The answer is always of course a resounding Yes I am always more than happy to bless these devotional gifts that you will be sharing with your loved ones during these important times of life When an item is blessed it becomes a sacramental sacramental is an object that through the blessing of the Church is set apart for the praise of God and meant to assist in deepening our relationship with Him Through the use of a sacramental we are called to open ourselves more fully to the grace of God present in our lives To learn more about sacramentals including their biblical roots and their practical nature please see the insert in this bulletin To have an item blessed you can simply ask me after any of our Masses or stop by our Parish Office during the week If I am out of the office at that moment you are welcome to leave any devotional items with Michelle in the office I will bless the object as soon as I am back in the office so that it ll be ready to be picked up Visiting the Past The Old Church on Cherry Street In 1965 our parish campus was moved from the old church on Cherry Street to our current home Prior to that our parish family had gathered for Mass and the Sacraments at the old church since 1875 The current location of the old church is actually its second location It was first erected in 1875 where the former rectory now stands The entire building was lifted and carried the 50 yards to its current location after the church basement had been dug In 1965 the old church was decommissioned as a Catholic Church and transferred hands at least twice between differing ecclesial communities Several years ago it was renovated into a residential house The current owners Klint and Sarah have been continuing this renovation as this house becomes a home for them and their family At the same time they have been very dutiful in preserving the wonderful history that the building holds Earlier this year I was invited by the family to tour their home share some old photos with them of the church building from our archives and offer some insights into the architecture and design of the building itself Next month the family would like to hold an open house for parishioners who remember attending Mass at the old church on Cherry Street This opportunity would be a chance to both see the renovations that they have done and to share memories of the church itself with the couple They would like to incorporate and preserve as much of the history of the building including our parish's history within it as they continue their renovations If you attended the old church and are interested in joining us for this open house please call the Parish Office <a
