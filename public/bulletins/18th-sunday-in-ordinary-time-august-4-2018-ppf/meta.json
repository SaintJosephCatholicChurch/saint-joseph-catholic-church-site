August 5 2018 Year This coming weekend we welcome Fr Lawrence Teteh CSSp as our celebrant and mission speaker for our Sunday liturgies Fr Teteh is the pastor of St Therese in Fort Wayne and is one of several missionary priests serving in our dio cese from the Congregation of the Holy Ghost also known as the Spiritians High lighting the universality of the Church Fr Teteh will be relating to us the needs of our brothers and sisters in Christ in his home diocese of Onitsha Nigeria Our spiritual and financial support will help ensure the continued good work of the Holy Ghost Fathers in spreading the Gospel and offering aid to those in need As such a special second collection will be taken up next weekend to aid in the Holy Ghost Fathers missionary work in Nigeria Following the Multiplication of the Loaves our Lord now enters into the Bread of Life Discourse The crowds having found Him in Capernum ask for a sign reminiscent of the manna in the desert during the Exodus which we heard of in our first reading The manna they receive in Exodus nourishes their bodies along their journey satisfy their hunger and will daily be provided to them through Gods grace Jesus in the Gospel reveals that He is the new bread from heaven In the Eucharist we receive food for our spiritual journey which satisfies the hunger of our hearts and which is given to us by Jesus Himself as we unite ourselves to His Sacrifice at the altar during every Mass In receiving Him we are as St Paul de scribes renewed and changed This new bread from heaven Jesus Christ is to transform us into the saints we are called to be Parish Campus Updates Over the past two weeks I have had the chance to meet with our Parish Council our Finance Council and our Building and Grounds Committee regarding various projects related to our parish campus First an update to our Parking Lot Project As you may recall resealing of the parking lot was underway at the end of May The resealing was halted however as It quickly became apparent that the original asphalt parking lot having been in use for over 60 years is in need of greater repair than initially thought Ive asked our Building and Grounds Commit tee to determine the cost of relaying the majority of the lot which would ensure its longevity for years to come Future updates will be shared as we move along in this process Second an update regarding Church Security and the desire to make the Church more available as a place for prayer at all times of the day All three of our committees have agreed that this is a goal to work towards but that we must also ensure the safety of our Lord in the Holy Eucharist the Church building itself and of course each person who would seek to spend more time in prayer in the Church To this end then we will be looking into the possibility of both installing security cameras in the Church and adding a security door between the Church and Parish Center Updates will follow as we explore our options for increased security Finally an update regarding a slight change to the rectory that you may or may not notice in the coming weeks Along the backside of the rectory there are a cluster of very large arborvitae trees After speaking with Bret of the Grover Com pany who provides our excellent lawn care we have decided to remove these trees Given their size and location there is a strong possibility that their roots are caus ing damage to the foundation of the rectory While I will miss this beautiful green ery along the backside of the building this seems a necessary step to ensure the structural foundation of the rectory If you have any questions concerns or would like to discuss any of the above Parish Campus Updates my door is always open and I am happy to listen special Thank You to all those serving on our various parish committees and their guidance regarding these projects In Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF August 1112 2018 CANTORS 500 Nancy Leitz 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Jay Crisp
