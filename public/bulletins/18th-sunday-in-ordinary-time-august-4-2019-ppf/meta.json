Catholic University of America have ended and thanks be to God I passed all of them somehow I will begin the Fall classes at the end of this month but all of that work will be done online allowing me to remain right here at our parish While it was a blessing to live in Washington DC during the hot summer nothing will ever compare to the beauty of living right here at St Josephs Please know again of my gratitude for the warm welcome you showed both Fr Silvino and Fr Lane After classes had ended I had the opportunity to return to Indiana this past week I spent one day visiting with my parents in South Bend and the rest of the week at Lindenwood Conference Center in Plymouth IN In Plymouth I was attending conferences led by the Catholic Leadership Institute CLI to learn about their Next Generation Parish Program This is a national program that is currently working with over 60 parishes in four dioceses Bishop Rhoades has invited CLI to lead this program in our diocese and has personally invited St Josephs to be one of the participating parishes I was very excited to receive this invitation from the Bishop on behalf of the parish and believe that this program will be of great assistance to us as we work towards a fiveyear plan for the parish What is a Next Generation Parish It is an initiative that focuses on form ing missionary disciples Deepening our personal relationship with Jesus Christ we begin to grow in grace and through the strength of the Holy Spirit are sent out to proclaim the good news to every person that we meet Mark 1615 Next Gen eration Parish seeks to collaborate with each parish in creating a strategic plan that provides various opportunities for the deepening of that personal relationship with the Lord for each parishioner Once a strategic plan is created they will walk with our parish as we bring our plan to completion I do believe that this will be a wonderful opportunity for our parish and thank Bishop Rhoades for his invitation As we are beginning to work towards our fiveyear plan the Next Generation Parish program will serve as a tremendous asset as we direct where our parish is headed I will be speaking with the CLI Staff in the coming weeks as we begin to learn more about this program and how we can best collaborate together More information will be shared with you're garding this great opportunity here in the bulletin as we learn more Over the past two years our parish has held monthly Adoration through out the first Thursday of the month This initiative begun by Msgr Pius offers a wonderful chance to spend time in prayer before our Lord in the Blessed Sacra ment I have recently received several requests asking if the day of the week for this period of adoration could be changed It has been suggested to move allday Adoration from the first Thursday to the first Friday of the month As we now offer both a morning and evening Mass on First Fridays for the Sacred Heart this would allow our period of adoration to both begin and end with Mass I hope that it would also encourage more people to stop in for time in adoration As such we will plan on making this change to our schedule beginning in September If there may be any issues with this that I am unaware please let me know My door is always open As a reminder we also have Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament offered twice per week both on Tuesday mornings from 78 AM and Wednesday eve nings from 67 PM Time spent with the Lord is never wasted If youve never had the opportunity to spend time in adoration before I would encourage making an intentional effort to do so You may be surprised by how much even a few mo ments with the Lord in this most intimate of ways can change our very lives Faithfully in Christ and very happy to be home Fr David WEEKEND OF AUGUST 1011 2019 CANTORS 500 Nichole Decker 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Jay Crisp LECTORS 500 Glenn Ryan 730 Sarah McCorkle 1000 Dan Geimer EUCHARISTIC MINISTERS 500
