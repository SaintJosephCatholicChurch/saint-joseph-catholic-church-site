  "text": "Sixteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 23 2023 Congratulations to all who participated at the Wells County 4H Fair this week This weekend July 22nd 23rd the Church celebrates the Sixteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time It is also recognized as the third annual World Day for Grandparents and Elderly falling on the Sunday nearest to the Memorial of Sts Joachim and Anne parents of the Blessed Virgin Mary July 26th Parish Project Updates Part I Preparations to welcome the return of the old church bell to our parish campus continues While we initially planned to pour the concrete base for the bell at the beginning of June we paused the project due to additional work In addition to the bell there will be two flagpoles placed in the same area We are currently waiting on finalized quotes for the flagpoles and once received will be able to pour the concrete base and bring this project to completion We are nearing a starting date for the installation of the altar at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery Working with a Kansas based Catholic firm we have received diocesan approval to move forward with this project and are setting a date to begin work The altar will be of a simple design with an emblem of St Joseph at the base crucifixion scene will sit on the back portion of the altar serving as the focal point of the cemetery grounds In addition to these larger projects we've also completed a number of smaller projects over the past few weeks Last week the railings and doors throughout our campus were sanded down and repainted This week all of the carpeted areas in the Schaefer Parish Center the Gym and the Social Hall were steam cleaned With this work done our campus is ready to resume our Religious Education Classes this coming Fall Did You Know Holy Orders All members of the Church participate in the priesthood of all believers through Baptism However some men are called to serve Jesus and the Church in the ministerial priesthood through the celebration of the Sacrament of Holy Orders The Sacrament of Holy Orders is the Sacrament through which the mission of the Church entrusted by Jesus Christ to His apostles continues to be exercised in the world until the end of time This Sacrament is one of apostolic ministry and includes three degrees the episcopate bishop presbyterate priest and diaconate deacon Those who are called to be priests are ordained through the Rite of Ordination In celebrating this Rite men receive a permanent spiritual mark called an indelible character which signifies that they are ontologically united to Jesus and now possesses the authority to act in the power and place of the person of Jesus The Sacrament of Holy Orders was conferred by Jesus on His Apostles who were to continue His work and be His earthly representatives The Apostles first received their power from Jesus who instituted this Sacrament As the Father has sent me so now I send you John 2021 The further conferral of this Sacrament by the Apostles onto others by an external rite is revealed to us in both Acts 66 and 2 Timothy 16 where the Apostles perform the imposition of hands as they pray over those chosen for ministry This outward sign of the laying on of hands by the bishop has continued to the modern day This traceable lineage of laying on of hands from the Apostles to our bishops today has remained unbroken for over two thousand years And this outward sign is accompanied by an inward and spiritual grace The grace given in the Sacrament of Holy Orders is that those ordained are set apart authorized and spiritually empowered to act in the Name of God and of His Church as a Bishop Priest or Deacon Faithfully in Christ Fr David Prayer for Rain God in Whom we live and move and have our being grant us rain in due abundance that being sufficiently helped with temporal gifts we may seek with more confidence those that are eternal Through Christ our Lord Amen Saturday July 22 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am
