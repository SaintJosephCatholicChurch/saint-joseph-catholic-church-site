Ronnie Bonnie Burns Michael Green George Bitzer Dorothy Dottie Marbach THE MOST HOLY BODY AND BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST CORPUS CHRISTI PROCSSION JUNS 18 2017 11TH SUN ORD TIME Happy Fathers day My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all Today is the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ I hope you still remember that we shall have Eucharistic Procession today Sunday June 18 the CORPUS CHRISTI after the 7:30am Mass The Lord Himself said This is my Body This is my Blood My body is real food and my blood is real drink My dear brothers and sisters in Christ the Holy Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ it is real food and real drink The Blessed Sacrament the Holy Eucharist is the presence of the Lord among us his people In ordinary circumstances of life food and drink are the most essential need of the human person What food is to the body is what the Holy Eucharist is to the human soul The importance of the Holy Eucharist cannot be over emphasized It is the center of our Christian life It is the center of our Chris tian Catholic life It is apex the pivot of our life here on earth In the celebration of the Holy Mass we have two tables the table of the Word and the table of the table of the Eucharist The Lord Jesus is present in both tables That is why in the 1st Reading Moses said to the people Remember how for forty years now the Lord your God has directed all your journey in the desert Do not forget the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt He directed them by the Pillar of Cloud by day and Pillar of ire by the night This was the sign of the presence of God among his people And in the 2 Reading Paul admonished the Corinthians and all of us and said Brothers and sisters The cup of blessing that we bless is it not a participation in the Blood of Christ The bread the we break is it not a participation in the body of Christ So the bread is the Body of Christ and the wine is the Blood of Christ Do you believe in this Doc trine We need to believe in it In the Gospel Jn 65158 The Lord Jesus himself said I am the living bread that came down from heaven whoever eats this bread will live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world Do you believe in it The Jews did not believe him when He said it so He firmly said again Amen Amen I say to you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Men and drink his blood you do not have life within you Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day So we must eat it in order to be saved But we must be worthy before we eat it For this St Paul warned us and said that if anyone eats or drinks it unworthily the person is guilty of sacrilege We should desire to eat and drink the Body and Blood of Christ for our salvation But unfortunately some of us desire and hunger for things of less value such as power authority prestige honor money re spect etc These are good if we possess them in God So in the Holy Eucharist the Lord Jesus with his Father and the Holy Spirit is present among us His people The presence of the Lord among us is real He promised to be with us till the end of time When Saul was travelling to Damascus to persecute the Christians the Lord Jesus encountered him on the road and said Saul Saul why are you persecuting me He did not say Why are you persecuting my followers Thus all the members of Christ are his body OK Therefore after the 7:30am Mass there will be Eucharistic Procession The procession is one of the ways we show our faith in the Lord Jesus that He is present in the Eucharist Do you believe this If you believe then make sure that you join the procession For we are not only washed clean in the blood of the Lamb we come into communion through the body and blood of the Lamb We need to praise and thank God for this precious gift and pray that the Eucharist will nourish us and make us worthy citizen of heaven Today is fathers Day so dear fathers Happy Fathers Day Let me briefly men tion the duty of fathers in the Family Every adult male married or not married is a father So it is the duty of every father to love all around him in the home in the of fice and everywhere If you are married you need to love your wife support the family even at the risk of your life He should stand by his wife and children in all circum stances except in evil loving teaching directing instructing guiding advising lead ing caring and forgiving the wife children and all around him That is what it means to be a father and a husband good father trains his children Sir 3013 says He who loves his son and daughter too chastises himher often that heshe may be his joy when heshe grows up Vs 7 says He who spoils his sondaughter will have many wounds to bandage Do not be afraid to train and instruct your children It is your holy duty Do it well Fatherhusband read Ephesians 52133 Msgr Pius will be out of town from June 19 to 23 2017 for Priests Annual Retreat at State Park at Angola Be assured I will pray for each every one of you God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Remember Heaven
