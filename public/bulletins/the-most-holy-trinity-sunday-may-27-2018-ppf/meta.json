YR 8TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YR THE MYSTERY OF THE TRIUM GOD CANNOT BE FULLY COMPREHENDED Still We are invited to the Ineffable Mystery of the Triune God Remember that next Sunday is the Solemnity of the Body and Blood of Christ As such there will be Eucharistic Procession from 8 30 am to 9:15am everybody is invited to participate My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say the Lord with you all Today we celebrate The Ineffable Mystery of the Triune God For every Christian Catholic the most first probable thing we were taught by our parents about our Religion is the Trinity It is taught by teaching us to make the sign of the Cross In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit Amen It is the expression of the belief in the Triune God the three Per sons in One God The Trinitarian doctrine is the most wonderful mystery we have in our religion It is the revelation of God as Father Son and Holy Spirit It tells us what God is for us But about the mysterious unity of the THREE Father Son and Holy Spirit we can not adequately and fully express it God cannot be completely comprehended by hu man concepts It is more important to relate with God than to seek to fully knowing Him An intimate persontoperson relationship with God gives us knowledge of God that cannot possibly be expressed in human word and terminology It is that kind of knowledge of God that satisfies a human being Oh how wonderful is the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his ways God is One and God is Three In the 1st reading Dt 43234 3940 Moses expressed how the Hebrews experienced God It was through Gods inspiration that the Jews experienced God as One God In spired by God Moses said This is why you must now know and fix in your heart that the Lord is God in the heavens above and on earth below and that there is no other So there is only One God St Paul in the 2nd Reading Rom 81417 Admonished that if we want to experi ence God we must be totally involved As good children in a family are involved in the matters of the family so must we be involved in the family of God being coheirs with the Lord Jesus And from the Gospel Mt 281620 The Evangelist Matthew We learnt from the Bible that discipleship does not just mean following and learning from the master Yes follow learn but and must establish a strong persontoperson relationship It involves faith trust in the teacher So we need to have faith and trust in the Father in the Son and in the Holy Spirit All three Persons are One the Triune God the Holy Trinity The story and the experience of St Augustine expressed it so well that we should not disturb ourselves trying to comprehend the meaning of the Trinity We need just to believe trust and methodically and humbly study the trinity and left ourselves in the hands of God to teach us and in love relate to Him We need to pray and experience God You know the story I told you that some time age If you do not remember ask somebody or ask me NB 1 Remember that we shall have Eucharistic Procession on June 3rd the So lemnity of the Precious Body and Blood of Christ after the 7:30am Mass Please make some effort to join in the Eucharistic procession It is a way of professing our faith and expressing our love to the Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist 2 As I told you last Sunday the
