  "text": "Sixteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 17 2022 This weekend July 16th 17th the Church celebrates the Sixteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Having heard the Parable of the Good Samaritan last weekend Luke 1025 37 this weekend we now visit the home of Martha and Mary Luke 1038 42 In the Good Samaritan we heard of love of neighbor At the home of Martha and Mary we hear of the love of God As we heard last weekend these two aspects love of God and neighbor are the two great commandments We express our love of God in how we treat our neighbor and in loving our neighbor made in the image and likeness of God we have the opportunity to encounter the face of Christ This understanding of love prepares us to for next weekend's Gospel on prayer Luke 111 13 This past weekend I had the wonderful opportunity to return to our parish and celebrate a wedding with our parish family Congratulations to our newlyweds Isabel and Jacob After celebrating with our newlyweds I then spent time with family before returning to Washington DC By the time that you read this I will just be completing my July semester midterm exam in Eastern Catholic Law Most of my time for the remaining two weeks will be spent reviewing for our upcoming Oral Comprehensive Exams After the exams I am planning to spend two days at Mount St Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg MD Having spent six years at Mount St Mary's I always enjoy the opportunity to return and spend time in prayer on Mary's Mountain From Emmitsburg I will be returning to St Joseph's and settling back in for the beginning of August When back this past weekend I was able to see some of the additional work completed in the rectory At the beginning of June I had mentioned the wonderful work done by Fairway Floor Covering In addition to updating the rectory flooring the first floor of the rectory received fresh coats of paint the first in a number of years for some rooms and some new blinds in a number of the bedroom windows replacing the original blinds and curtains Many thanks to the many hands and volunteers who made this possible After returning in August I look forward to hosting a second open house at the rectory in the Fall to show off some of these recent improvements Though it has been three years since our first open house and the beginning of this project I am happy to see the rectory upkeep nearing completion As with any house general maintenance and upkeep is always needed over time to help ensure the longevity of the building In addition to the work done on the rectory other work continues on our campus Earlier this week excavation began for the installation of our new parish playground The new playground equipment is on schedule to be installed by the end of the month This was made possible thanks to the wonderful support and fundraising efforts of both our Knights of Columbus and GIRL's Night Out As you may have noticed the playground site has been moved to the opposite side of our backdrive closer to the Rosary Path and further away from the Parish Gym This slight move has helped to alleviate drainage issues that were occurring alongside the south wall of the Parish Gym The section where the old playground had been will be seeded for grass this Fall Once the playground is fully installed we will be placing several picnic tables nearby to encourage the area's use We recently received a bequest and free will donation to dedicate one such picnic table in honor of a recently passed parishioner If you would be interested in making a similar memorial gift for the dedication of a picnic table please contact the Parish Office for more information Have a blessed weekend Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday July 16 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm
