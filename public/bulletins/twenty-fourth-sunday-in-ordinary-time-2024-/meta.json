the Church celebrates the Twenty fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time Over the past three weekends and continuing for two more our second reading has been taken from the Letter of St James Tradition holds that St James is the Apostle known as St James the Lesser son of Alpheus Matthew 103 As seen in the Acts of the Apostles St James served as the Bishop of Jerusalem before facing martyrdom in AD 62 As we hear from the Letter of St James we may begin to see how it shows itself to be intensely practical Offering short statements regarding the basics of living out a life in Christ this letter serves almost as a New Testament form of wisdom literature similar to that Proverbs or Sirach Though unique among New Testament letters the Letter of St James is one worth revisiting quite frequently especially in our own prayerful reading of the Scriptures St Francis Summer Reading Program With the final tally in the participants of our St Francis Summer Reading Program read a total of 4350 pages Congratulations to our top three readers 1 Landen 2 Louis and 3 Peter Our three top readers will be given the opportunity to choose from several prizes in the Parish Office St Joseph Catholic Cemetery It is with great joy that we can now announce that the altar at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery has been completed Earlier this week a crucifixion scene was secured atop the altar pictured here This crucifixion scene the final piece of the altar to be installed serves as a beacon of hope reminding us of the eternal life won for us by the victory of Jesus Passion special Thank You to both The Monument Center and ThomaRich Lemler Funeral Home for their diligent work in bringing this project to completion and the family of Wayne Bud and Sharon Miller for their generous donation of the altar and statuary in memory of their parents Introductory Rites The Confiteor Having received the unique greeting at the beginning of Mass The Lord be with you we respond And with your spirit This equally unique response acknowledges the presence and working of the Holy Spirit through the priest in virtue of his ordination This response affirms that the priest is acting in the person of Jesus in persona Christi capitas and performs the sacred duties of the liturgy through the power of the Holy Spirit Having greeted one another we now prepare to approach the Lord exactly as St Justin Martyr recorded in the 2nd Century Assemble on the Lord's day and break bread and offer the Eucharist but first make confession of your faults so that your sacrifice may be a pure one Before approaching the altar of the Lord we first acknowledge our own sinfulness and ask for God's help in the Penitential Rite Participating in this rite with a true interior repentance can bring about one's own conversion Described by St Thomas Aquinas in the 13th Century the Penitential Rite is an act proceeding from grace in detestation of venial sin as when one is moved fervently to God Though different from the Sacrament of Confession this rite when prayed fervently can still move our hearts to conversion and bring about a desire to seek reconciliation with others The Penitential Rite itself has a communal nature to it Though we do not name our sins in it we are nevertheless admitting our guilt not only to God but to all those present This highlights the social effects of sin where sin affects not just our relationship with God but our relationships with each other Weekend of September 21st 22nd 500 David Smith 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Jay Crisp Adult Choir 500 Marita Crawfis 730 Barb Ault 1000 Ellie
