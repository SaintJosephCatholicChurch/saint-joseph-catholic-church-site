  "text": "Fifteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 16 2023 This weekend July 15th 16th the Church celebrates the Fifteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time special Thank You to Fr Bill Sullivan for serving as the celebrant of our Masses so that I could join our day pilgrimage to Maria Stein Entering into a new fiscal year earlier this month we've recently closed out the past fiscal year In a desire to continue providing fiscal transparency to our parish family I have asked our Finance Council to prepare a Parish Finance Report for the 2022 2023 Year This report which will become an annual report will provide an overview of the past fiscal year and our desire to prudently use that with which you have entrusted to us Among other things I know that this report will highlight the support we have been able to provide to local causes made through our monthly St Vincent de Paul Fund Your continued generosity to St Joseph's makes it possible for us to give back to our community Thank you so much for making it possible for us to have a presence here and support the good work happening in our community responding to Christ's call to see Him in those in need Did You Know The Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick Having looked at the Sacrament of Confession last weekend this weekend we now look at the second of the Sacraments of Healing Anointing of the Sick As Confession heals the wounded soul so the Anointing of the Sick or Extreme Unction is meant to prepare the soul for eternity While this Sacrament can bring about a healing of the body it's primary purpose is to heal the soul This does not mean however that the Anointing of the Sick is only for those who are at the point of death Instead as soon as any member of the Faithful begins to be at risk of the danger of death due to sickness or old age they may request and benefit from this Sacrament This Sacrament can even be repeated if the faithful's illness becomes worse or another serious sickness afflicts them The outward sign and institution of this Sacrament itself are found in the same places in the Sacred Scriptures Just as our Lord institutes this Sacrament and sends out His Apostles to anoint with oil and heal Mark 67 13 so we hear of this same Sacrament put into practice from St James The outward sign of oil is used to anoint those who are ill In both the Old and New Testaments the use of oil represented both healing and nourishment eg Isaiah 16 Luke 1034 This Sacrament gives grace through healing and strengthening of body and soul It confers a special grace which unites the sick person more intimately to the Passion of Christ for both his own good and the good of all the Church It gives comfort peace and courage to the ill and can even provide the forgiveness of sins for those unable to make a confession If it is the will of God it can even brings about the restoration of physical health Faithfully in Christ Fr David Diocesan Bulletin Notice Indiana Catholic Conference Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ We as Catholics have a duty to bring morality into the public forum The Indiana Catholic Conference ICC works to bring morality into the public forum by educating policy makers and politicians on Catholic Social Teaching and the impact it can have on proposed laws While the ICC had some successes during the most recent Indiana General Assembly session with expanding
