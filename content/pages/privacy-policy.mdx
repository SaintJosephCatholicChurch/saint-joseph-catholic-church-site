<h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>
<div>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site&rsquo;s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser&rsquo;s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</div>
<h3>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h3>
<div>As you use our website, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web server&rsquo;s log files, allow us to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</div>
<div>Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.</div>
<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
<div>Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.</div>
