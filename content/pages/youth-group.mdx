<p>The St. Joseph Catholic Church Youth Group is a co-educational ministry open to high school aged students from all three Wells County schools and beyond.&nbsp; During the academic year, we meet between the Sunday morning Masses at 8:30 &ndash; 9:45 A.M., and periodically over the summer.&nbsp; Following the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, we focus on deepening our faith through fellowship with one another, works of service, learning more about our Catholic faith, and experiencing fun outings as well.&nbsp; Our Youth Group is overseen by our Youth Team, who consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steve Wagner</li>
<li>Abraham Herr</li>
<li>McKenna Herr</li>
<li>Ben&nbsp;Wagner</li>
<li>Christine Zadylak</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage all high school teens to join us in this fun and ever-evolving ministry of the Church.&nbsp; For more information, please contact our Youth Team via email <a href="mailto:stjosephyouth@adamswells.com">stjosephchurch@adamswells.com.</a>&nbsp;We look forward to welcoming you to the group!</p>
