  "text": "JOSEPH ESPONSE TO THE ORONAVIRUS As was announced last weekend Bishop Rhoades has directed all parishes in our Diocese to adopt several precautionary measures at Masses for the remainder of the flu season and in response to the Coronavirus These directives include Refraining from holding hands during the Our Father omitting the optional Sign of Peace after the Our Father and suspending distribution of the Most Precious Blood from the chalice If and when additional directives are shared by the Diocese we will also adopt those measures helping to ensure the health and wellbeing of our parish family Bishop Rhoades also encourages that anyone who is sick or has symptoms of being sick to remain home so as not to spread illness I would also encourage each of us to pray in a special way through the intercession of St Joseph Patron of the Universal Church and our parish May we ask St Joseph to intercede on our behalf to Our Lord Jesus Christ for protection from the Coronavirus healing for those who have already been infected and mercy and eternal rest for those who have died In addition to our own precautions we have also been informed from our area nursing homes that they are suspending outside activities for the foreseeable future These activities include our monthly Masses at River Terrace and Christian Care as well as our weekly Communion Calls and visits to all of the nursing homes If you have a loved one in a nursing home within Wells County that would like to see a priest or who has fallen ill and needs to receive the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick please call the Parish Office 824 1380 to let us know This will allow us to contact the nursing home and make the necessary arrangements to visit as soon as possible Third Sunday of Lent March 15 2020 This weekend the Church celebrates the 3rd Sunday of Lent This Sunday marks the first of the three Scrutinies which are ancient practices dating back to the 2nd Century that serve as a time of intense preparation for Catechumens preparing for Baptism and Candidates preparing to enter into full communion with the Catholic Church Our Gospels throughout the next three weekends will focus on the call to conversion and the universal call to holiness for our Catechumens our Candidates and ourselves We are called to use these forty days of Lent to renew ourselves and our relationship with the Lord By renewing all and every part of our lives in Christ we prepare ourselves to celebrate both individually and as a family the joy of Easter Sunday As a parish we attempt to offer many different chances for renewal through the Sacraments times for prayer and fraternity together Recognizing that our Lenten journey is one that is often very different depending on where we are in life it is my prayer that our parish can offer a wide variety of opportunities for growth in the spiritual life to aid all of our parishioners in their personal Lenten journey This week we continue our parish Novena to St Joseph additional copies of which are available in the narthex This novena leads us to the celebration of the Solemnity of St Joseph Spouse of the Blessed Virgin To celebrate this great feast of our patron we will offer two Masses on Thursday March 19th 8 AM and 7 PM Following the 7 PM Mass our Social Committee will be hosting an ice cream sundae bar in celebration of St Joseph coming from the
