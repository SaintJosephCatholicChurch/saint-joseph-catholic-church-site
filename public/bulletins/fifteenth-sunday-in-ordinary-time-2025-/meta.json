nary Time Gn 181 10a Ps 152 5 Col 124 28 Lk 1038 42 Fifteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 13 2025 This weekend July 12th 13th the Church celebrates the Fifteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time In our readings the command to love God and to love neighbor are joined together as one Our first reading from Deuteronomy reminds us that this command is not something unattainable but is near to us in our hearts and minds The Church therefore encourages us to contemplate what it means to truly love others and to be a good neighbor to them The Parable of the Good Samaritan reminds us that true compassion towards our neighbor is not about status or convenience but about taking action when others are in need Jesus calls us to go beyond societal norms and expectations to be the neighbor who extends mercy Like the Good Samaritan we are invited to bind wounds care for the suffering and love those who are hurting even when it's difficult or inconvenient Today being a Good Samaritan is more accessible than we may realize saint of the not to far past St Teresa of Calcutta exemplifies this She didn't hesitate to touch and care for the wounded even when it meant sacrificing her own comfort Her actions remind us that mercy and love are not remote ideals but practical choices that can transform lives Or in her own words Help one person at a time and always start with the person nearest you Next weekend we have two wonderful opportunities after our weekend Masses First we ll welcome our Totus Tuus Missionaries who will speak briefly and personally invite our youth to join the week long Totus Tuus summer program Second members of our Cookbook Committee will be in the narthex sharing delicious recipe samples straight from our brand new parish cookbook St Joe Cooks Cookbooks will be available for purchase for just 15 and will make a great addition to your kitchen or as a gift for others St Joseph Giving Table As the summer continues our St Joseph Giving Table is now in the narthex This annual table is open for everyone to use If you have extra fruits or vegetables from your garden that you don't want to go to waste please feel free to place them on the table to share Likewise if you see something on the table you can use you're welcome to take it home or even enjoy it on the way home from Mass In this way we help ensure that nothing goes to waste Church Renovation Updates After our last update I mentioned that we had received approval from our Diocesan Finance Committee to move forward into the bid process for our upcoming renovations We have been in contact with three Fort Wayne based construction firms Shawnee Schenkel Weigand that come recommended from our Diocesan Office of Worship All three firms intend to bid to lead the construction phase of our project As a part of this process our architectural firm has been preparing detailed construction designs that these three companies will use throughout the bidding process I will sit down with Bill Heyer and his architectural team next week for a finalized review of the construction set Once we approve the sets and they are finalized they will be presented to the construction companies to initiate the bidding process This move into the bidding phase of this process will once again return us to our Diocesan Finance Committee We will share the bids as received with this diocesan committee to receive additional guidance as we determine which bid to accept At this stage we will hopefully be discussing timeframes with the various companies as a part of the bidding process I look forward to sharing more as soon as I receive more information Fr David Great holiness consists in carrying out the little duties of each moment St Josemara Escriv ORG Our Parish Code 7N68MY Weekend of
