have now returned to the liturgical season of Ordinary Time the first Sunday following Pentecost is always celebrated as Trinity Sunday The Apostles sent out by the Holy Spirit following Pentecost are sent to preach the very mystery of the Trinity Itself God is love and invite us into this mystery With this invitation we must see that the days that lie ahead are not meant to be ordinary This time is called ordinary only insomuch as these liturgical weeks are numbered ordinal meaning numbers in a series Having been invited into the triune mystery this time is truly meant to be extraordinary Through the Holy Spirit the love of the triune God is alive in our souls How will this love change how we live out our daily lives In addition to our liturgical celebration our nation also marks this weekend as Father's Day Many countries throughout the world celebrate Father's Day in March on St Joseph's Day placing the foster father of our Lord as a model for fatherhood Though we might celebrate these two on different days we can still find in St Joseph our parish patron a true model of fatherly love and under whose prayerful protection we now entrust our fathers As such we wish a Happy Father's Day to all those in our parish who are fathers grandfathers godfathers uncles and all those who provide fatherly care to others in so many ways By living out your vocation of fatherhood you help to reveal to us glimpses of God the Father Thank you for living out your vocation Know of our love gratitude and prayers for you May St Joseph foster father of Jesus intercede for you before the throne of God Helping Hands Baby Bottle Campaign On Mother's Day we started the Baby Bottle Campaign to support Helping Hands a local pregnancy and family resource center As this campaign comes to an end baby bottles can be returned either in the collection basket or to the Parish Office through next weekend After next weekend baby bottles can be returned directly to Helping Hands 116 Dustman Road Bluffton Thank you for your support of this local resource and ministry Bonfire behind the Rectory June 23rd at 7:00PM Join me for a bonfire behind the Rectory next Monday June 23rd at 7 PM Celebrating the Vigil of the Nativity of St John the Baptist we call to mind the words of St John as we bless and sit around the evening fire He must increase I must decrease John 330 This feast day celebrated as early as the 4th Century was greeted with evening bonfires by the early 6th Century This ancient practice originally came about as a way to baptize the pagan celebrations of the summer solstice In celebration of the solstice as the days began to grow shorter bonfires were built to honor the sun By baptizing this practice the honor once given to the sun was redirected to the true Light of the world Jesus Christ the Son of God Come and enjoy this evening of prayer fellowship and's mores as we mark this beautiful and symbolic feast together All ages are welcome Bring a lawn chair if you'd like Parish Directory 2025 Anniversary Edition Our last attempt at creating a Parish Directory three years ago was carried out entirely through volunteer efforts While everyone who had a picture taken received great 4x6 photos back the physical directory itself was never printed due to various setbacks including some of our key volunteers moving away Learning from that experience we are excited to announce that this year's directory will be produced with the professional assistance of Universal Church Directories who help compile and print the physical directory itself We are currently setting a timetable with their representatives but are looking for a time in August to take photos More to come soon In Christ Fr David Weekend of June 21st 22nd 5:00pm Sam Smith 7:30am Mike
