  "text": "WENTY IFTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME September 20 2020 This weekend Sept 19th20th the Church celebrates the 25th Sunday in Ordinary Time Having completed the fourth discourse we are now being prepared to receive the fifth and final discourse from St Matthews Gospel The Discourse on the End Times Though it is preparing us for the fifth discourse our Gospel from today Matthew 20116 does offer us a beautiful insight over our theme of reconciliation from the past two weekends Its never too late Just as in the parable of the workers in the vineyard the Lord calls out to us at every stage of our life It is never too late to respond It is never too late to turn to the Lord It is never too late to reconcile ourselves to God if we are but willing to ask His forgiveness It is never too late to be reconciled with God Turn to Him today What Does It Mean To Be Catholic Interested in learning more about the Catholic Faith Join us on Thursday October 1st at 6:00PM for an informal and informational gathering about our upcoming Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults RCIA Sessions At this gathering we will look at a brief overview of Church History and discuss what the RCIA Process looks like for all those who are interested Over the coming months our RCIA sessions will provide us with an overview of the Catholic Faith We will first look at the Creed then the Commandments and finally the Sacraments and Prayer Our look at these topics will help to explain Catholic teaching and its basis found through in the Sacred Scriptures Our RCIA sessions are open to all interested individuals for those who are Catholic and wish to deepen their knowledge about the Church for those who are not Catholic but wish to learn what it means to be Catholic and for those who wish to prepare for full initiation into the Church at the Easter Vigil If you know of anyone interested in learning more about the Catholic Church please consider personally inviting them to join us during these sessions and consider journeying along with them Technology Updates Digital Bulletin Board and LiveStreaming System Thanks to the generosity of a parishioner we have mounted a digital bulletin board in the narthex Utilizing a wall mounted television and a DVD Player this system allows us to display uptodate information regarding upcoming parish events It will also be used to play picture slideshows often shown during funeral visitations held in the narthex prior to the Mass of Christian Burial for our beloved deceased This past Friday local Stylus Technologies began the installation of our new livestreaming system for the church This system will utilize a highdefinition camera placed near the choir loft providing a full view of the church It has the ability to swivel and zoom allowing a widerange of different camera angles to accommodate our various liturgies Mass Stations of the Cross etc The system will be tied into the church sound system providing the best quality sound for those joining us at home This upgrade from our current system will improve the experience of watching our liturgies for those parishioners who cannot yet join us in person at church It will also become an invaluable tool that can be used to livestream other liturgies including funerals and weddings to help include those family members who may not be able to travel for major events We hope for the installation to be completed later this week Thank you for your financial support of this project Reminder Updated Friday Daily Mass Time As a reminder this week will mark a change in our daily Mass times Starting this Friday Sept 25th our Friday daily Mass will now be offered at 8:30AM All other daily Mass times remain the same Tuesday Thursday and Saturday at 8:00AM Wednesday at
