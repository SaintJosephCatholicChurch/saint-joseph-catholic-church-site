  "text": "IXTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME EBRUARY 14 2021 Entering into the Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time February 13th 14th we are making our final preparations for the beginning of Lent Even as the snow continues to fall Lent is meant to serve as the hopeful beginning of a spiritual springtime that leads to Gods manifold grace blossoming forth on Easter Sunday Over these forty days of prayer fasting and almsgiving may we discern both what graces from this past year that we seek to make longlasting in our lives and which practices we need to restore or add to our lives to receive the new gifts Christ wishes to share with us this year As we once again enter into this season of fasting our lives are once again meant to mirror the fasting of the Churchs liturgy Throughout Lent the liturgy itself is stripped bare and we fast from the simple beauty we often take for granted There are no longer flowers surrounding the altar The colorful vestments of the priest exclusively turn to violet reflecting the penitential nature of the season Our candlesticks and altar crucifix turn to wood to draw our minds to the noble simplicity of the season Unbleached wax candles are used with these wooden candlesticks as the somber tones of unbleached wax harmonize with the mournful tone of the season And finally neither the Gloria nor the Alleluia will pass from our lips again until we rejoice together at the Easter Vigil To begin our Lenten journey Mass on Ash Wednesday will be offered at 7:00am Noon and 7:00pm As previously mentioned there will be a change regarding how ashes are distributed at Mass Following the guidance of the Vatican ashes will be sprinkled upon the top of the head instead of being marked on the forehead This practice traditionally done in Europe prevents unnecessary physical contact as a precaution during the ongoing pandemic The sprinkling of ashes over each individual also more clearly calls to mind the biblical practice of putting on sackcloth and ashes such as seen in Nehemiah On the twentyfourth day of this month the Israelites gathered together while fasting and wearing sackcloth their heads covered with dust Nehemiah 91 However the ashes might be received the interior repentance expressed by this exterior act is at the heart of the action Throughout the Lenten Season you are invited to join us every Friday evening for the Stations of the Cross at 7:00pm starting this Friday February 19th Join us either inperson or via livestream on our parish Facebook page In addition to this devotion consider joining us for daily Mass throughout the week Daily Masses are offered every Tuesday Thursday and Saturday at 8:00am Wednesday at 7:00pm and Friday at 8:30am Throughout Lent we will be adding an extra hour of Confession every Friday prior to Stations Confessions are heard every Tuesday at 830900 am Wednesday at 600645 pm Friday at 600645 pm Satuday at 400445 pm and by appointment Faithfully in Christ Fr David common question asked on Ash Wednesday May nonCatholics come forward to receive ashes The answer Yes Ashes are not a Sacrament but are a sacramental like the Sign of the Cross Receiving ashes does not signify a communion of faith beyond a need for repentance and a remembrance of our own mortality All people of good will acknowledging their need for repentance are welcome and invited to come forward and receive ashes on Ash Wednesday MASS INTENTIONS Saturday February 13 8:00am Special Intention 4:00pm Confessions 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm David Paul Butler Sunday February 14 Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time
