202738 or 20272438 THIRTYFIRST SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME November 3 2019 Throughout the month of November we are called to pray in a special way for all those who have gone before us Our memorial candles will burn alongside our statues of the Blessed Mother and St Joseph all month and I invite you to write the names of loved ones who have passed in the past year in our Parish Book of Prayer Intentions in the narthex Parish Updates When entering the parking lot please take note of the additional handicap spots recently added by Libys Stripe Right The addition of these spots brings the resurfacing of our parking lot begun this past August to a close We received our yearly walkthru from our insurance agent at Catholic Mutual earlier this week and we received glowing marks regarding both the new parking lot and our increased ex terior lighting These improvements to the parish campus have helped us to address past points of improvements recommended in previous walkthrus One issue that Catholic Mutual has asked us to address involves our votive candles in the Church If you are making use of the smaller votive candles near the statues of the Sacred Heart or St Therese Lisieux please do not move the candles from one glass votive to another Each candle has a small metal disk at its base to hold the candles wick When a candle has burned out that metal disk need to be re moved from the glass votive before a new candle is placed inside Otherwise the can dle will be lopsided burn against the side of the glass votive and due to the heat risk shattering the glass votive If a candle has burned out please refrain from putting a new candle in the glass votive We try to replace any burned out candles every few days Next weekend we will welcome Fr Dermot Gahan as the celebrant at our Masses Fr Gahan is a priest of the Diocese of Fern in Ireland and is currently on loan to our diocese as the associate pastor at St Matthew CoCathedral in South Bend While Fr Gahan is with us I will be away for a few days travelling with my brother priests Fr Bob Garrow my seminary classmate and pastor of St Anthony de Padua in South Bend and Fr Nathan Maskal associate pastor of St Pius in Granger Our diocese is wellknown for our priestly fraternity evidenced by our 27 young men studying for the priesthood in our diocese more than all four other dio ceses in Indiana combined As such I cherish these chances to travel with my brother priests spend time together and grow in our fraternal bonds as brothers in Christ Shortly after arriving at St Josephs you may recall that I had the wonderful opportunity to travel to the Vatican for a whirlwind trip with several priests represent ing our diocese at the diaconate ordination of nowFr Spenser St Louis in St Peters This year we will again be visiting the Vatican Unlike the past whirlwind trip how ever this year will allow us the opportunity to actually visit and spend time in prayer at the holy sites We will also be visiting with Fr Spenser who is completing one last year of studies in Rome before returning home to our diocese three of our seminari ans now studying at the North American College and a few priestfriends from our seminary days who work in the Vatican While we are traveling you all will remain in my prayers and I will be offer ing Mass for our parish family at the various pilgrim sites we visit If you have any specific prayer intentions please email them to me at <a href=\"frdavidvioligmail.com\">frdavidvioligmail.com</a> and I will carry them with me throughout our travels To help accommodate Fr Gahan while he is with us there will be a few changes to our weekday Mass Schedule in the coming week Our weekend Mass schedule remains unchanged Please look at the weekday Mass Schedule here in the bulletin for those changes I thank you for the warm welcome that I know you will show Fr Gahan and I look forward to being back with you on the following weekend Faithfully in Christ Fr David Wherever
