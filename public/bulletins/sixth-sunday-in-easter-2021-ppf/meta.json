  "text": "IXTH UNDAY ASTER AY 9 2021 Happy Mothers Day to all of the mothers of our parish Whether the mother of a child a grandmother an adoptive mother a godmother a spiritual mother and all those who share in the vocation of motherhood know of our love and gratitude for you not only on this day but everyday We commend you to the prayers of our Blessed Mother Mary Mother of God and Mother of the Church and give thanks to God for the way that you fulfill your vocation We also remember all those women who long to share in this celebration For those who experience the cross of infertility know that we pray for you today and that we love and support you Many more people experience this reality than we imagine Know that you are not alone We pray today as well for all expectant mothers especially those for whom the choice loving to accept their child was not easy We are grateful for their witness to life Regardless of their circumstances we should lovingly embrace all mothers who choose life for their children and support them in their efforts In the words of our Holy Father Pope Francis In the journey of life let us allow ourselves to be taken by the hand Mothers take their children by the hand and lovingly introduce them to life We need to learn from mothers that heroism is shown in selfgiving strength in compassion wisdom in meekness PDATED ITURGICAL IRECTIVES ISINFECTING EWS AND SHERS As previously noted Bishop Rhoades after consultation with various medical specialists recognized the extreme rarity of both surface and waterborne transmission of the novel coronavirus Armed with this knowledge our diocese allowed the return of hymnals to the pews and the refilling of Holy Water fonts In addition to these allowance parishes have also received updated guidelines on how to best disinfect pews and how often to do so Following our diocesan guidelines and now knowing of the extreme rarity of surface transmission we will no longer individually wipe down the pews with Clorox Wipes after each Mass Instead we will be making use of a disinfecting spray which while just as effective as Clorox Wipes is less damaging to the pews The pews will be disinfected prior to our weekend Masses and if able to arrange the assistance of enough volunteers between weekend Masses With this movement forward we are also now ready to resume having Ushers serving at each of our weekend Masses Ushers serve as the welcoming face of the parish greeting each person as they enter the church building Ushers also assist individuals in finding seating among the pews especially if the church is particularly full can assist parishioners with any specific individual needs that might arise and distribute bulletins after each Mass has concluded If you would be willing to serve as an Usher for the weekend Mass that you normally attend please either see the signup sheet in the narthex or contact the Parish Office Faithfully in Christ Fr David Note Due to my schedule
