Dorothy Dottie Marbach 12Th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME JUNE 25 2017 YRA From the Pastors Desk WE ARE INVITED TO BE WITNESS OF GOD AND NEVER FEAR My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I peace with you all I am back from my Annual Priests Retreat at Angola It all went well and thanks to God I prayed each of you and all your loved ones Thanks for your own prayers for me Remember that Tuesday June 27 2017 my home Bishop Most Rev Hilary Paul Okeke will celebrate the Holy Mass for and with us The Holy Mass starts by 6:00pm and party starts after Mass about 6:30pm It is POT LUCK PARTY Everybody is invited We all are invited by God to be witnesses As witnesses of God and the Lord Jesus Christ and of our faith we must not fear In the 1st Reading Jer 201013 Prophet Jeremiah witnessed without fear The mys tery of Kingdom of God can only be known by the witness of those who are committed with their faith Who are they It you and me All of us So Jeremiah despite the plot of the enemies of God and faith denounced evil without fear That is what we are called to do Listen to what Jeremiah said about those who wanted to kill him because he op posed their evil way of life Yes I hear the whispering of many Terror on every side Denounce him Let us denounce Jeremiah was frightened by his enemies but he remained steadfast in telling the truth witnessing to Gods commandment God came to his rescue and he said Sing to the Lord for he has rescued the life of the poor from the power of the wicked You see God always come to the help of his messengers In the 2nd Reading Rom 51215St Paul explained to us how sin and dearth entered the world If by one mans sin everyone sinned and thus death by one Mans obedi ence grace entered the world and by that grace we gain life we shall not be afraid of death For Christ has conquered sin and death So do not be afraid to bear witness for God and the Lord Jesus Christ In the Gospel Mt 102633 The Lord Jesus Himself assured us of his support He said to the 12 Apostles and to us Fear no one what you hear whispered proclaim on the housetops And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather be afraid of the one who can destroy both body and soul in Gehenna That is in hell So what you need to fear is sin for it destroys both body and soul in hell Gods protection is assured as said in the Gospel Are not sparrows sold for a small coin Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Fathers knowledge So do not be afraid you are worth more than many sparrows You see You hear that Let us trust God and do Gods worl well and He will protect us and save God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it SCRIPTUREMASS READINGS FOR
