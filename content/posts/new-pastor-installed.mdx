<p>The Most Reverend Kevin C. Rhoades, Bishop of Fort Wayne-South Bend, leads the celebration of an installation Mass on Saturday to recognize Father David Violi, left, as the new pastor at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Bluffton.</p>
<p>Father Violi was ordained as a priest in June 2016 and has assisted at three parishes in South Bend since then. St. Joseph is his first parish as pastor. Also concelebrating the Mass at the Bluffton church was Father Dennis Di Benedetto, right, who is a parochial vicar at St. Charles Borromeo Parish in Fort Wayne and a good friend of Father Violi.</p>
