THE LORD JESUS HE WAS TRANSFIGURED BEFORE THEM My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all The Lord Jesus was transfigured in glory The Son of Man has received kingship and dominion He will come again in glory Are you ready waiting for Him This Feast was celebrated in the 5th century by the East Syrians It was inserted into the General Liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church in 1457 by Pope Cal listus III to celebrate the defeat of Turks at Belgrade as announced in Rome on August 6th of that year August 6th occurs 40 days before the Feast of Exaltation of the Holy Cross September 14th Cf March 12 the 2nd Sunday of Lent 2017 You also still remember that today August 6th and 9th are the anniversaries of the atomic explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 As we recall these sad events we are urged to continue to pray for peace in the world In todays Liturgy we meditate on the Transfiguration of the Lord Jesus Christ It is the celebration of His Kingship over creation It is the manifestation of Christs Divin ity In this mystery we anticipate a renewed awareness of the invisible reality that will be ours in the future Listen to todays Entrance Antiphon In the shining cloud the Spirit is seen from it the cloud the voice of the Father is heard This is my Son my beloved in whom is all my delight Listen to Him This is our hope We shall be like Him if we obey him So in the 1st Reading Dn 7910 1314 The young prophet Daniel prophesied what will happen on the last day when the Trinity the three Persons will take Their Seats to judge the whole world as One God He said among other things Thrones were set up and the Ancient One took his throne The court was convened and books were open his kingship shall not be destroyed Now as you see yourself sitting right here in this Church Take home question IS YOUR NAME WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE In the 2nd Reading 2 Pt 11619 An Eye Witnesses St Peter James and John testified what he saw Are you one of those who do not believe and are doubting Christ was exalted in order to strengthen the faith of the 3 against the scan dal of the Cross They saw the exalted essential glory of the Lord that will be revealed when He comes again All this mean a renewed awareness of our own exaltation that will to come to us at the end of our lives Peter said we had been eyewit nesses of his majesty For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the unique declaration came to him from the majestic glory This is my Son my beloved with whom I am well pleased Listen to him We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven while we were with him on the mountain ANY DOUBT It is true Strive to be there when it will happen again In the Gospel Mt 1719 We are invited to see the Lord Jesus as he really is He is the King of creation Listen In the exalted Christ we see ourselves as we will be when our time comes This faith awareness should encourage us to keep going and stay firm when we are faced with what looks like insurmountable difficulties hardship depression and darkness in faith and in life Be courageous When Peter James and John were amazingly over whelmed with what they saw the Majestic Divinity of Jesus the Lord Peter exclaimed Lord it is good that we are here If you wish I will make three tents here one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah Peter forgot himself James and John While he was still speaking a voice came from heaven and said This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased listen to him Are you listening to Jesus the Lord and King We must listen His if we want to be saved Once again IS YOUR NAME WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE ANY DOUBT DO YOU LISTEN TO JESUS Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 We are organizing Marriage Encounter Parish Based Please register quickly 2 We are also planning a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land next year It will be after
