in Or dinary Time Ez 22 5 Ps 1231 4 2 Cor 127 10 Mk 61 6a Thirteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time June 30 2024 Join us on Thursday July 4th at 9 AM for Mass to begin Independence Day by first giving thanks to God for the many freedoms that we as a nation enjoy This weekend June 29th 30th the Church celebrates the Thirteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time As we continue in Ordinary Time it may be useful to reorient where we are in our lectionary cycle Continuing in Year of our three year cycle we are moving sequentially through the Gospel of St Mark Over the next several months we will prayerfully hear a substantial amount from this gospel with only a brief interlude from St John's Gospel Summer Upkeep Projects Following a busy week with our Totus Tuus Summer Program seen on this weekend's bulletin cover this past week has been fairly low key at the parish Taking advantage of this lull in events we had the carpets cleaned throughout the narthex Parish Center Social Hall and Gym special Thank You to Mr's Cleaning Restoration for their quick work The sacristy has also received a fresh coat of paint this week special Thank You to Twilla Herr for giving of her time to paint The sacristy is not only where the priest servers and lector physically prepare for Mass but also spiritually It is my hope throughout this summer to continue enhancing the sacristy as a place of prayer and preparation We also learned this past week that our pipe organ is in need of some major and immediate repairs The screen behind the choir loft hides the pipes for our pipe organ One of the ranks or rows of pipes have begun to collapse in itself due to age and weaknesses in the material the pipes are made out of This row will need to be removed to prevent collapse and damage to the whole organ In addition several internal parts of a pipe organ are made with leather As our pipe organ is original to the Church these parts have exceeded their lifespan and the leather has become brittle with age and cracked Thankfully the leather can be replaced and the parts rebuilt We will be looking at having immediate maintenance done this summer and major rebuilding next summer Mission Speaker VINE Initiative Next weekend we welcome Fr Levi Nkwocha as the celebrant for our weekend Masses Fr Levi is a priest of the Archdiocese of Owerri in Nigeria but has served in our diocese for years Having obtained his Doctorate in Theology from Notre Dame he is currently serving as pastor of St Michael the Archangel in Waterloo and an assistant professor at the University of Saint Francis in Fort Wayne In addition to his ministry in our diocese Fr Levi has also founded and helps to direct the VINE Initiative Begun in 2019 this initiative seeks to provide food clothing medical assistance and education to widows orphans and the poorest of the poor in Nigeria and beyond Serving as our annual mission speaker Fr Levi will share next weekend about the good work being performed by the VINE Initiative and how we can support their work In anticipation of next weekend Fr Levi sent a number of brochures about the VINE Initiative available in the narthex After having a chance to hear from Fr Levi next weekend we will then take up a special second collection the following weekend July 13th 14th to offer financial support to the VINE Initiative I encourage you to prayerfully discern how we can best support this ministry serving our brothers and sisters throughout the world Knights of Columbus Donation American and Vatican Flags special Thank You to our Knights of Columbus for donating new flags for our campus Being in a high wind area our American and Vatican flags have quickly seen their share of wear and tear since our flag poles were installed this past fall Our Knights have generously offered to provide new flags every year This will allow us to retire the older damaged flags each year so that they can be properly and respectfully disposed of In Christ Fr David PARISH
