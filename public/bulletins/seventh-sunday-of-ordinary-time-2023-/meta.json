  "text": "Seventh Sunday in Ordinary Time February 19 2023 This weekend February 18th 19th the Church celebrates the Seventh Sunday in Ordinary Time Continuing from the last two weekends this weekend was formerly known as Quinquagesima Sunday as it marks the last Sunday before Ash Wednesday and the start of Lent Appropriately this weekend's readings reflect some of the Lord's most difficult commands including turning the other cheek May we reflect upon these challenges of the Lord as we discern how He is calling us to enter into our Lenten disciplines of prayer fasting and almsgiving With the start of Lent upon us this Wednesday February 22nd we will have Masses for Ash Wednesday offered at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM As a reminder Ash Wednesday is a day of fasting and abstinence On this day we abstain from meat as we also do every Friday throughout Lent and limit ourselves to one normal and two small meals throughout the day These biblical practices of fasting Matthew 914 15 and abstinence Daniel 102 3 serve to strengthen our practice of self discipline and remind us of our true end which is not here on earth but in heaven Entering into Lent we will notice several liturgical changes or absences that emphasize the penitential nature of this season Our sanctuary becomes a bit more bare with less floral decorations present The gilded crucifix candlesticks and bleached candles replaced with a wooden crucifix candlesticks and unbleached candles Even our words will become more sparse as both the Gloria and the Alleluia will not pass our lips again until Easter Sunday Musically we will for the first time this year be omitting the closing hymn at the end of Mass After the closing blessing and the recitation of the St Michael Prayer we will recess out of the Church in silence throughout Lent save for Laetare Sunday This practice is encouraged by our Bishops Conference in their document Sing to the Lord Music in Divine Worship which encourages a silent recessional during Lent Sing to the Lord paragraph 199 to allow for periods of deeper reflection and prayer after Mass Over the past many months Bishop Rhoades at both the Priest Education Days and the recent Eucharistic talks has reemphasized and encouraged the use of silence in the liturgy Sharing from the above document Bishop reemphasized that God is revealed both in the beauty of song and in the power of silence Silence in the Liturgy allows the community to reflect on what it has heard and experienced and to open its heart to the mystery celebrated This moment of silence is also another way to enter into our year's theme Lord teach us to pray Distribution of the Most Precious Blood Earlier this month our diocesan Office of Worship gave notice that Bishop Rhoades has given permission to resume the distribution of the Most Precious Blood at Mass in the coming weeks He has asked each pastor to discern if how and when this practice resumes in each parish keeping in mind the local practice of the parish itself For our parish we will plan to resume the distribution of the Most Precious Blood starting on Easter Sunday April 8th 9th As a reminder we receive the fullness of the Real Presence of our Lord when receiving the Eucharist under either species of the Sacred Host or the Most Precious Blood Reception under both species though not required simply offers a fuller sign of the Eucharistic banquet as described in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal paragraph 281 Whether receiving under one or both species may we always seek to live joyfully and gratefully by the strength of this heavenly food as in it we share in the death and resurrection of the Lord Eucharisticum Mysterium paragraph 13 To assist with the reverent distribution of the Most Precious Blood we will be seeking the assistance of two Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion per Mass For those who have previously been trained to assist in this ministry please watch for an email this week with details on how to be added to the monthly minister's schedule For those who would like to learn more about this ministry please contact the Parish Office for more information MASS INTENTIONS
