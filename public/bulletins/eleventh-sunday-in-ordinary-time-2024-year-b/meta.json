weekend June 15th16th the Church celebrates the Eleventh Sunday in Ordinary Time Continuing in St Mark's Gospel we are in the midst of the Lord's public ministry as He teaches the Apostles through His words and deeds Today we hear the parable of the seed's growth unique to Mark's Gospel and the parable of the mustard seed shared in all three synoptic Gos pels Matthew Mark and Luke These parables offering descriptions of the Kingdom of God remind us that great things often first begin as little things sometimes even the smallest of things God can and will work amidst all things no matter how great or small Even if at times we cannot fully grasp how He is working we trust that He is In the same way He invites us to participate in His work Even the seemingly little actions of our daily lives can help bring about the Kingdom In addition to the celebration of the Eleventh Sunday in Ordinary Time our nation also marks Father's Day this weekend Many countries throughout the world actually celebrate Father's Day on St Joseph's Day finding in the foster father of our Lord a model for all fatherhood Though we celebrate these two on different days in our nation we can still find in St Joseph our parish patron that true model of fatherly love with imitation by all fathers As such we wish a Happy Father's Day to all those in our parish who are fathers grandfathers godfathers uncles and all who provide a father's care to others in so many ways By living out your vocation of fatherhood you help to help reveal to us glimpses of the very fatherhood of God Thank you for living out your vocation Know of our love and gratitude for you May St Joseph foster father of Jesus intercede for you before the throne of God Ministry Opportunity Calling all Seamstresses This summer we are hoping to start a ministry for those who are able to help prepare linen and cloth frontals and coverings for our altar and sanctuary Though we have many different fabrics and colors for our Decorating Committee to work with we only have a few pieces that are customized to specifically fit on top of our altars and for use in the sanctuary If you are skilled with thread and a needle or a sewing machine and would be interested in helping to make custom pieces for use in the Church please contact the Parish Office for more information Totus Tuus Summer Youth Program We welcome our Totus Tuus Missionaries at all Masses this weekend At the end of the Mass they will be offering a personal invitation to our parish youth to join them for our summer youth program this coming week The entire parish is also invited to our Potluck Supper this Tuesday June 18th at 5 PM in the Parish Social Hall The parish will provide the entree and we will have a chance to meet and hear more about our summer missionaries Please note the changes in our daily Mass schedule for this coming week As a part of our youth program this week daily Mass will be offered this week Monday Friday at 11:15AM and Adoration will be on Wednesday from 715 8:15PM and Thursday from 125 2:25PM Little Free Library You may have noticed in the News Banner earlier this week that our parish received preliminary approval from the Parks Department to place a Little Free Library along the Interurban Trail Little Free Library is a free standing structure that serves as a free take a book share a book location There are only a handful of such libraries throughout our community As one of our summer projects we will be looking into installing a small library near the bench alongside the Interurban Trail at the front of our parish's property Given the foot traffic that we often see along the trail this seemed to be a good way to increase our outreach to and interaction with our local community PARISH
