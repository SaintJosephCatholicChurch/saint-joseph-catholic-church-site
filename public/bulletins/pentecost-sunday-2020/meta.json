  "text": "ENTECOST May 31 2020 This weekend the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Pentecost Fifty days following Easter Sunday Pentkost is Greek for Fiftieth this day was traditionally considered the second greatest feast day of the liturgical year On this day prior to the Gospel Alleluia a sequence would be sung similar to the Victimae Paschali Laudes Sequence Praise to the Paschal Victim sung throughout the Octave of Easter For Pentecost the sequence is the Veni Sancte Spiritus Come Holy Spirit This year we will hear the sequence recited prior to the Gospel In this sequence we ask for the Holy Spirit to come into our lives to fill our hearts and to provide joys that never end As Pentecost marks the end of the Easter Season we ask the Holy Spirit to remain within us so that we might know the joy of the resurrection each and every day of our lives Just like the earliest disciples the Holy Spirit pushes each and every one of us into the world We are sent to help others become disciples to listen to the Lord speaking to us in His Word to learn how to pray in a more intensive way to live the Gospel more faithfully in our daily lives and to seek out the Fathers will and have the courage to follow it While this mission may seem overwhelming we take courage in knowing that we do not approach it alone Through the Holy Spirit first received in the Sacrament of Baptism we are united to the entire Body of Christ In the Sacrament of Confirmation we receive a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit that fills us with gifts and fruits to help us fulfill our mis sion of preaching the name of Jesus in everything that we do Sacrament of Confirmation and Reception into the Church Celebrating the Solemnity of Pentecost we welcome Bp Rhoades to St Josephs for a special Mass with our 8th Grade Religious Education Confirmandi Our five students Emma Emma Gabe Rapehael and Samuel have spent this past year learning about and preparing to receive this great Sacrament This preparation will come to fulfillment Saturday May 30th as they are anointed with Sacred Chrism and through the hands of our Bishop receive this outpouring of the Holy Spirit special Thank You to all of our wonderful Religious Education volunteers who have helped prepare our 8th Graders for this Sacrament In addition to celebrating with our Confirmandi we also have another reason to rejoice this weekend as we welcome our five Elect Quinn and Candidates for Full Communion Bruce Eric Kat and Shar into the Catholic Church Each of these men and women have spent the past year in formal preparation
