  "text": "Solemnity of Mary The Holy Mother of God and The Octave Day of the Nativity of the Lord January 1 2023 Please know of my profound gratitude for the many cards gifts and treats that were received over Christmas Day Thank you Merry Christmas The Church continues her Christmas celebrations this weekend Dec 31st Jan 1st as she celebrates the eighth and final day of the Christmas Octave Our Christmas celebrations will continue in Christmastide with the celebrations of the Epiphany of the Lord next weekend and the Baptism of the Lord the following Monday We will even see a brief Christmas resurgence on February 2nd with the celebration of the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord or Candlemas While such drawn out celebrations of Christmas may seem a bit strange especially as our secular culture often moves on from Christmas immediately after Christmas Day these celebrations are truly of great importance The joy of Christmas cannot be contained by a single day As such these celebrations have not only been held for centuries in the life of the Church but also have a profound biblical grounding and should not be so easily forgotten or ignored Beginning on Christmas Day the Church celebrates the Christmas Octave as eight days in which we visit the stable in Bethlehem and adore the divine Son of Mary Each of these eight days is seen as a reflection of Christmas Day itself The Octave Day marking the eighth day of Christmas recognizes the Jewish practices of the ritual purification of a mother following childbirth Leviticus 121 3 and the naming and circumcision of a male child eight days after birth as a sign of Israel's Covenant with God Genesis 1712 The Octave Day of Christmas has itself throughout history held several names reflecting these biblical truths in the life of our Lord and our Blessed Mother Previously referred to as the Feast of the Circumcision of the Lord and the Feast of the Naming of Jesus this day Jan 1st is once again known by the even more ancient name The Solemnity of Mary Mother of God This name in conformity with the ancient liturgy celebrated in Rome is meant to commemorate the part played by Mary in the mystery of salvation The name of this ancient feast itself arises from the teaching of the Church in the 5th Century The Council of Ephesus declared Mary as the Mother of God in AD 431 affirming that Jesus is one divine person with two natures His mother's human nature and His Father's divine nature Let us not be surprised then at the enthusiasm and profound respect by which the Church extols the Blessed Virgin She has brought Him forth the Infant God she adores Him Him who she has the right to call her Child and He in turn God as He is calls her in strictest truth His Mother The following weekend will bring us to the Feast of the Epiphany which is another continuation of the mystery of Christmas This celebration is followed by the Baptism of the Lord which ends the Christmas season on our modern liturgical calendar There is however a brief Christmas resurgence on Feb 2nd as the Presentation of the Lord marks forty days since Christmas Day It would be on this day when the Christ child would be presented in the Temple in fulfillment of the Law of Moses Leviticus 124 8 New Friend for the New Year As you leave Church this weekend you are invited to take the name of a Saint from
