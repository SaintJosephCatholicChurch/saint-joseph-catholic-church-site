  "text": "ECOND UNDAY IN RDINARY IME ANUARY 17 2021 This weekend January 16th 17th brings us into the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time The name of this season Ordinary Time comes from the Latin adjective ordinalis which is translated as either number or succession This time falls between the joyous season of Christmas and the penitential season of Lent Having just celebrated the mystery of the Incarnation our focus now shifts from the mysteries of the life of Christ and focuses on how we are called to respond to these mysteries in our daily lives In other words How does our Christian Faith call each of us to live differently than the world especially given the many challenges we face This focus is also reflected in our Gospel reading John 13542 today Our Lord asks the two disciples today What are you looking for and He invites them to come and spend time with Him It was at this moment when they first encountered the Lord that their lives changes One of the two St John even remembers the specific time of day It was about four in the afternoon though many years have passed since that first moment Why does St John remember even the time of day Because that is the very moment he first fell in love with the Lord and everything changed How has encountering the Risen Lord changed our lives How do we live life differently as Christians Christ is meant to inflame our hearts and sparks of this fire should be seen in everything that we do to set the world ablaze Luke 1249 We are called to love in truth speaking truth with charity Ephesians 415 We are called to love our neighbors James 28 We are called to love even our enemies Matthew 544 In this love of Christ lived out in our everyday lives we can truly begin to change the world Though the season itself may be called ordinary this time is a chance for extraordinary growth in grace as disciples of Jesus Christ We will remain in this season of Ordinary Time until we mark the beginning of our Lenten journey on Ash Wednesday February 17th As Lent is quickly approaching being only a month away it is a good time to prayerfully begin discerning how we will approach Lent this year This coming season of prayer fasting almsgiving and penance serves as a chance to put aside the things of this world which fade away and to focus on the eternal glories that know no end 1 John 217 By beginning our preparations now the coming Forty Days of Lent will not catch us by surprise Instead we will be ready to welcome this season as a chance to deepen our relationship with the Lord This coming Friday January 22nd marks the 48th commemoration of both Roe vs Wade and the lesser known Doe vs Bolton These two Supreme Court decisions labeled abortion a constitutional right and removed many of the factors limiting abortions throughout our country These decisions reflect what Pope Francis often speaks of as a throwaway culture However we place our ultimate trust in Gods providence We are reminded time and again in Scripture to seek the Lords help and as a people of faith we believe that our prayers are heard We are asked to observe this particular day as a day of prayer focusing especially on the penitential practices of prayer fasting and almsgiving May our prayers and actions help to bring about a true culture of life in our nation and our world that recognizes and respects the dignity of every person from conception to natural death and at every moment inbetween Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday January 16 8:00am Special Intention 4:00pm Confessions 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Marcel
