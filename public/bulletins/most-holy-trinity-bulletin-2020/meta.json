  "text": "MOST HOLY TRINITY June 6 2020 With the close of the Easter Season this weeknd June 6th7th brings back into the liturgical season of Ordinary Time This weekend and the next however have two special solemnities that will keep us from wearing the liturgical color of Ordinary Time Green This weekend we celebrate the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity and next weekend the Solemnity of Corpus Christi or the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ These two so lemnities put our focus on the love of God as we return to Ordinary Time This weekend the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity reveals to us that the eternal love of God is the uncreated first foundation and final goal of all creation ourselves included To quote St Augustine from the 4th Century You have made us for yourself Lord and our hearts are restless until they rest in you Or as many parishioners might remember from their Catechism lessons God made us to show forth His goodness and to share with us His everlasting happiness in heaven Next weekend the Solemnity of Corpus Christi celebrates the love of God given to us in the great gift of the Most Holy Eucharist In this gift Je sus Christ gives Himself to us in the most unique and real of ways In the mid19th Century St Therese of Lisieux contemplated this wondrous gift as she wrote Do you realize that Jesus is there in the tabernacle ex pressly for you for you alone He burns with the desire to come into your heart God loves us He wants us to be with Him and He has given Him self to us at the altar so that we might be in union communion with Him As our Lord comes to us we must desire to bring Him to every person Following our 10 AM Mass on Corpus Christi June 14th Incense will be used at this Mass we will have a period of adoration of the Blessed Sac rament and a Eucharistic Procession around our parish campus In this way we proclaim our belief of Jesus Real Presence in the Eucharist and bring salvation Himself out into the world In a procession He leads us into the world and as His disciples we follow behind Him keeping an appro priate social distance as we do so With Jesus Himself leading us we have nothing to fear Congratulations Fr Stephen Felicichia This Saturday June 6th Bishop Rhoades ordained six young men to the diaconate and one deacon to the priesthood We congratulate Father Stephen Felicichia as he joins our priestly fraternity and begins his priestly ministry in our Diocese We also congratulate our six new Deacons Logan Parrish Augustine Onuoha Michael Ammer Benjamin Landrigan Keeton Lockwood and Paolo Degasperi Over the years God has granted our diocese with the blessing of many priestly vocations Let us continue to pray for vocations throughout our diocese and from our own parish Fr Felicichia has been with us these many past months since returning from the seminary and will remain in residence at St Josephs until he be gins his first priestly assignment Bp Rhoades has appointed him as the new associate pastor of St Elizabeth Ann Seton in Fort Wayne effective June 23rd After ordination Fr Felicichia celebrated his first Mass at his home parish of St Therese in Fort Wayne This coming weekend he will be with us to celebrate Mass for the Solemnity of Corpus Christi and to join in our Eucharistic Procession after the 10 AM Mass It has been a true joy to have Fr Felicichia in residence at St Josephs He has been a tremendous ministerial help in our parish response and outreach throughout the suspension of public Masses Ive also personally enjoyed our priestly and spiritual fraternity within the rectory forming a communal prayer routine similar to that found in the seminary St Jo sephs wishes Fr Felicichia the best as he prepares for his first assign ment and ask that God bless him in his priestly ministry MASS INTENTIONS Saturday June 6 No Morning Mass today 4:00pm Confessions 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Jim Mueller Sunday June 7 The Most Holy Trinity Sunday 7:10am Rosary 7:30am Evelyn Morrissey
