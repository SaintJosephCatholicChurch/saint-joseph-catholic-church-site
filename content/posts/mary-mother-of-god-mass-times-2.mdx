<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This <strong>Friday (Jan. 1st)</strong>, the Church celebrates the <strong>Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God</strong>, which marks the end of the Christmas Octave (but not the Christmas season). While this celebration is a yearly Holy Day, the&nbsp; obligation to attend the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass on this day remains&nbsp; dispensed by Bishop Rhoades due to COVID-19. Though not a Holy Day of Obligation this year, may we see it as a <strong>holy day of opportunity</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those able to join us in person, <strong>Masses will be offered on Thursday, Dec. 31st, at 5 PM and Friday, Jan. 1st, at 7:30 AM and 10 AM. (The 10 AM Mass will be live-streamed.)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We welcome Fr. Nathan Maskal as our celebrant for the Solemnity Masses.</span></p>
