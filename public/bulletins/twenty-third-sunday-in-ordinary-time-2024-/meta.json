Spiritual Report Every two years our diocesan Business Office audits all parishes in our diocese During our latest parish audit it was recommended that we begin publishing an annual financial report at the end of the fiscal year In our diocese the fiscal year begins on July 1st and ends on June 30th After this year closed out our business manager Michelle our Finance Council and myself have prepared our parish's first annual financial report for release While being prudent stewards of our parish finances is of great importance it is not the only factor for us to consider when looking at the health of our parish For this reason our financial report is joined by a spiritual report reviewing the sacramental life of our parish family over this past year Both reports were approved by our Parish Council and are included in this bulletin and available on the parish website for your review Book Study The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri In the 4th Century St Augustine of Hippo said He who wishes often to be with God ought to pray frequently and read pious books In the past I've often offered Bible studies in the Fall This year I would like to invite you to join me in a journey through The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri This momentous poetic work is arguably one of the greatest poems ever written as it undertakes a deep spiritual reflection on morality Starting on Monday Sept 23rd at 6:30PM in the Parish Conference Room we will meet every other Monday as we journey through The Divine Comedy This work is itself broken into three sections The Inferno Purgatory and Paradise We begin our journey delving into the Inferno and progressing level by infernal level to its diabolical depths The journey itself is meant to move man from misery in the Inferno towards the happiness of Paradise There is no cost for this book study While you are welcome to purchase or use your own copy of The Divine Comedy I will also be making available free PDF copies of our material for each session If you would like to join me in this poetic journey please see the sign up sheet in the Narthex Introductory Rites The Lord Be With You The Introductory Rites of the Mass begins first in the Entrance Procession Symbolically the procession moves us from the narthex representing the world toward the Sanctuary representing heaven This is a reminder that in the words of St Augustine we are journeying toward you Lord Here below we have no lasting dwelling place but seek one which is to come since our home is in heaven The procession enters into the Sanctuary and ends at the altar which the priest greets with a kiss The altar itself serves as a symbol of Jesus and the kiss is meant both as reverence towards the sacrifice of Christ which happens upon it and as a symbol of the union of the Spouse Christ and His Bride the Church at the Wedding Feast of the Lamb Finally as the priest reaches the presider's chair we join together in making the Sign of the Cross The Sign of the Cross remains one of the most ancient of Christian prayers In word and action we proclaim both the Triune God and Jesus's sacrificial love for us on Calvary In this prayer we are meant to recognize that our help is in the name of the Lord who makes Heaven and Earth Psalm 1248 And this help upon whom we call is immediately reflected in our greeting together The Lord be with You And with your spirit This is no ordinary greeting It is instead a personal call from God towards an awesome mission Many in the Bible were greeted and called to their own daunting missions with these same words of our Lord The Blessed Virgin King David Moses and Jeremiah These simple people were asked to perform great works that may have sounded impossible to them Yet God spoke to them as He speaks to us now With the strongest of assurance that I the Lord will be with you The Lord is with us We never walk this journey alone Weekend of September 14th 15th 500 Teresa Smith 730 Donna Geisel 1000 David Smith
