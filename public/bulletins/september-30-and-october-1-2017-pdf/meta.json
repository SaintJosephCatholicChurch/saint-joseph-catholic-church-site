IN ORDINARY TIME SEPT 30OCT 1 YR OBIDIENCE RESPONSIBILTY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE IMPORTANT IN LIFE My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all I am out of State this weekend We welcome Fr Jose who is celebrating the Mass with us You are welcome Fr Jose I want to thank you all for the wonderful Annual Bishops Appeal Pledge you did last Sunday I am praying for you all May the Lord God continue to bless you all In todays Liturgy we all are reminded that obedience responsibility and account ability are important in life and in our salvation We need to be responsible for what ever we do Projection is as old as Adam and Eve Adam failed to accept the responsi bility of his actions and projected it to Eve Thus he responded when God asked him he said The woman gave me and I ate it And in her own turn Eve projected her responsibility to Satan and said The serpent tricked me into it so I ate it And in our own time we used to say Not I but heshe did it Heshe is responsible not I Projec tion is bad Listen to this a child was asked Who broke the cup The child said The cup got broken Thus refusing to accept the responsibility of an act In the 1st Reading Ez 182528 Prophet Ezekiel was admonishing the Hebrews who were deported to Babylon to accept the responsibility of their sins and repent so as to obtain Gods forgiveness They were projecting their actions to God that what God did was wrong Let it be clear to us that human freedom implies full responsibility for what we did what we are doing and what we shall do Thus in the 2nd Reading Phil 2111St Paul admonished us and said Do noth ing out of selfishness or out of vainglory rather humbly regard others as more impor tant than yourselves each looking out not for his own interests but for those of others Let the kind of mind that is in Christ Jesus also be in you Though he was God but did not cling to it but humbled himself and became obedient and died on the cross We need to be as humbles as Christ is in all we do And in the Gospel Mt 212832 We read the episode of two sons whose father asked them to do something for him The first son refused but later changed his mind and did what his father told him to do He obeyed The second accepted to do it but did not do it The first son was commended for doing his fathers will He represented took care of his actions The sinners tax collectors prostitutes who first rejected the king dom but later repented asked for forgiveness were forgiven and were saved The sec ond son represents people of double dealing who claim selfrighteous who cover up their sins These people will have problem on the Day of Judgment Their salvation has some serious question marks But those who accepted responsibility for their sins asked for forgiveness are forgiven and they are saved Let us be humble enough to accept our sins Let us be responsible and accountable for all our actions Have open mind heart and eyes for the real Christian values so that God will continue to fill us with his gift of love NB 1 We are organizing Marriage Encounter Parish Based Please register quickly 2 We are also planning a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land to join in the Foot Steps of Jesus
