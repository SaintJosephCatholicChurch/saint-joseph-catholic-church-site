  "text": "The Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ June 11 2023 This weekend June 10th 11th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Corpus Christi Traced back to the middle of the 13th Century this devotion began in Belgium and quickly spread throughout the world Within only two decades Pope Urban IV added this solemnity to the universal liturgical calendar so that it could be celebrated throughout the whole Church The Solemnity of Corpus Christi actually falls on the Thursday after the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity In the United States however this day is transferred to the nearest Sunday to allow for greater celebration Originally placed on a Thursday this solemnity is itself intimately connected to the Last Supper celebrated annually on Holy Thursday As the Lord instituted the Holy Eucharist on Holy Thursday it is fitting that this celebration of the Body and Blood of Christ is itself originally placed on a Thursday While the day a celebration falls may seem like a small matter the Church takes seriously the call to sanctify all things including all time itself The significance of days is a profound reminder that our lives are finite and that time should not be squandered As the Psalmist said teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom Psalm 9012 More than anything it reminds us that time is a gift from God With him and through him all things are holy and nothing is without meaning Pilgrimages Near and Far We are currently planning a day trip on Saturday July 15th to the Shrine of the Holy Relics at Marie Stein Ohio The Shrine houses over 1200 relics has a museum and is a wonderful place for quiet prayer We are looking to charter a bus and arrange the pilgrimage to conclude with Mass and dinner at the Shrine before returning home sign up sheet is in the narthex for those interested in learning more information about this local pilgrimage opportunity For those who are interested in joining me for a 10 day pilgrimage to Italy I am currently finalizing the details with our tour group St Charles Catholic Pilgrimages We are planning for a 10 day pilgrimage from Feb 20th 29th 2024 that would take us to Rome Lanciano Cascia Assisi Siena and Florence These cities are homes to Eucharistic miracles from throughout the centuries I will be hosting an informational session in the coming weeks as the details are finalized Did You Know The Most Holy Eucharist The Eucharist is the Sacrament by which Catholics receive the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ For Catholics this is the most treasured gift given to the Church by the Lord Himself at the Last Supper While we encounter the grace of Jesus in each of the seven Sacraments in the Sacrament of the Eucharist we also encounter Jesus Himself in a unique way Body Blood Soul and Divinity The bread and wine that normally nourish the body become His Body and Blood that nourishes our souls An outward sign This reality of the Eucharist the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist is a supernatural gift that we recognize each and every time we come to Mass We are meant to reflect our belief in the Eucharist through our gestures at Mass eg genuflecting kneeling bowing etc The words of consecration spoken by the priest in the Liturgy of the Eucharist themselves come from the first Eucharist celebrated at the Last Supper given by Christ As we hear in our Gospel today taken from the Bread of Life Discourse in John's Gospel Jesus leaves no room for confusion He is offering us His Body and Blood However while we know this truth in our heads we still may have a hard time convincing our hearts Sometimes we have difficulty making ourselves aware of His Real Presence We recognize the great mystery of the Eucharist This is the mystery and the truth that we encounter at every Mass because it is Jesus who meets us in such intimacy every time we assist at Mass There can be no greater intimacy in this life which is why the Eucharist is often called the source and summit of the Christian life Lumen Gentium 11 In the Eucharist our loving God nourishes strengthens and heals us to give grace Saturday June 10 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am
