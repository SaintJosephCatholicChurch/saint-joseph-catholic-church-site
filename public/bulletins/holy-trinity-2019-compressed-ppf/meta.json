our pro found gratitude for your fatherhood In the great vocation of fatherhood you reflect the love strength generosity wisdom and mercy of God the Father Your witness of love has helped each of us grow deeper in our rela tionship with Jesus Christ May you experience Gods blessing in your life today and everyday as we celebrate the gift of fatherhood and may St Joseph fosterfather of our Lord and protector of the Church be with you this day Trinity Sunday which we celebrate this weekend following Pente cost is an ancient celebration of the Holy Trinity With the rise of Arian ism a 4th Century heresy denying Jesus divinity the Church defined and defended Jesus divine sonship at the Council of Niceae 325 AD From this council we received the Nicene Creed the same Creed we profess to gether every Sunday after the general intercessions Following the council many early Church Fathers such as Sts Athanasius 373 AD and Ephrem 373 AD composed prayers and hymns to emphasize the doctrine of the TrinityExalting the triune nature of God these prayers and hymns were adopted into use during the Churchs liturgies in the 4th and 5th Centuries By the 12th Century the Solemnity of Trinity Sunday as we know it today was introduced and by the 13th Century was added to the universal Church calendar by Pope John XXII This celebration highlights the rela tionship between God the Father the Son the Holy Spirit as reflected in our readings today This relationship is one of true love a love that gives itself fully and completely to another This love is of course shown to us perfectly in the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the Cross which we are made present to at each and every Mass We are invited into this relationship of true love and have begun to participate in it as the love of God has been poured into our hearts Romans 55 through the Holy Spirit Our celebration of Fathers Day offers a glimpse of this relationship here on earth as we see it reflected in the selfsacrificial love given by fathers and mothers to their children This complete gift of self reveals though veiled a vision of the love that God Himself offers to each of us His beloved children Our bulletin cover this weekend is a portion of the Trinity Dome from the National Shrine in Washington DC This central dome of the Ba silica was completed only two years ago on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception Circling the base of the dome is the text of the Nicene Creed Surrounding the image of the Trinity pictured on the cover is an image of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception patroness of our country and a procession of saints who have a strong association with our country In this dome we see the desire of our hearts To participate fully in the triune love of God as members of the Communion of Saints ARISH ENSUS AND UTREACH All registered parishioner families at St Josephs should have re ceived a letter from the parish this week detailing our upcoming parish outreach If you did not receive
