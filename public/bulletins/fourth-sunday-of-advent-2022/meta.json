  "text": "Fourth Sunday of Advent December 18 2022 Welcome home to our many university students who have or are returning home for the Christmas break May you have a restful time home This weekend December 17th 18th the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday of Advent With Christmas falling on Sunday this year this is the longest Advent season possible with all four full weeks May we take advantage of this extra Advent time by spiritual preparing for the Lord's birth One of the best ways to prepare is to take advantage of the many remaining opportunities we have for the beautiful Sacrament of Confession here at our parish In addition to this week's Advent Penance Service on Wednesday Dec 21st at 6 PM we also have our normal schedule of Confessions heard throughout the week There is no better preparation for the coming of the Lord At our Christmas Masses we often welcome a number visitors and other guests who are visiting with us for the holiday May we make extra efforts to welcome those whom we encounter as guests this Christmas While the Holy Family may not have found a warm welcome in Bethlehem we want to make sure that all of our guests whom we encounter are warmly welcomed as we celebrate together the mystery of the Incarnation of our Lord Christmas Mass Schedule As Christmas falls on a Sunday this year our Christmas celebration will take the place of our weekly Sunday obligation To help ensure that the chance to fulfill this obligation of assisting at Mass is as available as possible over our Christmas celebration there are four opportunities for Mass next weekend On Christmas Eve Saturday December 24th Mass will be offered at 4 PM and 6 PM The 4 PM Mass will include the blessing of our Nativity in the Church and our Children's Choir The 6 PM Mass will include our Adult Choir who will be leading Christmas Carols at 5:30PM prior to Mass for those who would like to sing along with our wonderful Choir On Christmas Day Sunday December 25th Mass will be offered at Midnight and 9 AM The Midnight Mass which is at Midnight will be offered solely by candlelight The 9 AM Mass will have a Christmas Brunch offered afterwards in the Parish Social Hall If you are planning to attend the Christmas Brunch even if attending a different Mass time please see the sign up sheet in the Narthex this weekend New Old Nativity Scene for the Parish As some may have seen in the newspaper a few weeks ago our city has continued the yearly tradition of placing a Nativity scene on the plaza outside of the courthouse This year however a new Nativity scene was purchased to replace the older one For those who might remember the older Nativity scene was originally lent to the city by our parish Having been purchased by our Knights of Columbus and placed on our parish campus sometime in the 1970s 1980s if not earlier there was a request to have it placed outside of the courthouse The parish agreed and it has been placed there every year for the Christmas season since Over the years the storage of the Nativity scene was handed off from the parish to the city and eventually to volunteers in town With the purchase of a new scene those storing the old one have offered to return it to St Joseph's so that it will continue to be used We are excited to welcome back this Nativity scene which has gained such a storied history both for our parish and our city The Nativity scene will once again be placed on the campus throughout the coming Christmas season close inspection of the Nativity scene will reveal that it is showing the wear of its years After the Christmas season it will be stored on the campus in our pole barn behind the Church When in storage after Christmas we will be seeking volunteers to help repair and restore the Nativity scene so that it can continue to be used by our parish for years to come MASS INTENTIONS Saturday December 17 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Parish Family
