June 27th 28th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Sts Peter and Paul Though celebrated annually this solemnity is tied to the specific date of their martyrdom June 29th and as such is often celebrated at Mass during the week When this date does fall on a Sunday however its celebration takes precedence over almost every other day including Sundays in Ordinary Time as we honor these two pillars of the Church This celebration is one of the more ancient and universal celebrations on our liturgical calendar Traceable as a local devotion in Rome to the mid 3rd Century devotion towards these two Princes of the Apostles quickly spread throughout the Christian world Though many other countries initially placed this celebration in December near to the Nativity of the Lord the Roman date of June 29th eventually received universal acknowledgement Fourth of July Mass at 9:00AM Begin your celebration of our nation's independence by first giving thanks to God the source of all freedom Join us for Mass this Friday July 4th at 9:00AM as we pray for our country and for lasting peace justice and unity both at home and throughout the world In the words of St Francis Xavier Cabrini our country's first Saint We must pray without tiring for the salvation of mankind does not depend on material success but on Jesus alone Rainy Day Repair Fund and Singular Bequests Thank you for your continued support of our Rainy Day Repair Fund This special collection included in our parish envelopes the first Sunday of each month helps to provide for campus maintenance and upkeep throughout the year In recent months this has included such minor expected costs as our annual lift inspection certification and major unexpected costs such as the need to replace an air handler from our AC System Your continuous and generous financial support of this fund helps us to be able provide for the upkeep of our parish campus For those who may not be able to support this monthly fund but would like to make a one time gift that supports our parish upkeep please contact the Parish Office to learn about making a bequest As a reminder bequests remain 100 at the parish 2025 Parish Directory We are working with Universal Church Directorie's for the creation of our upcoming 2025 Parish Pictorial Directory We have scheduled photo days for Wednesday August 13th through Saturday August 16th This scheduling takes into account that our various school districts will be back in session but that colleges will not yet have started We ll have more information about how to sign up for times in the next two weeks Mass Intentions One element of our Faith that is oftentimes misunderstood is the custom of offering Mass intentions Whenever a priest celebrates Mass that celebration is offered for a particular intention requested by a benefactor Just as we are able to pray for one another through our personal prayer so the Mass as the greatest prayer of the Church can be offered for special intentions When a Mass is celebrated for a requested intention that prayer like our personal prayer seeks grace from God on behalf of those for whom it is offered In this way the Church Herself through the celebration of the Mass places before God the specific intention of the benefactor This ancient practice unites our personal intentions with the Church's most perfect prayer Though the intentions most commonly offered are for our dearly departed loved ones Mass intentions can be offered for many different reasons for anniversaries birthdays special celebrations those who are sick in need or even in thanksgiving for prayers answered small stipend is customarily offered with an intention serving as a sign of the spiritual offering being made and of support towards the local parish priest If you would like to schedule a Mass intention please contact the Parish Office for more information Weekend of July 5th 6th MASSES Cantors 5:00pm David Smith 7:30am Donna Geisel 10:00am
