Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday of Lent also known as Laetare Sunday This name comes from the entrance antiphon of our Mass Rejoice Jerusalem and all who love her Be joyful all who were in mourning exult and be satisfied at her consoling breast cf Isaiah 6610 11 Being at the midpoint of our Lenten season this weekend serves as a reminder that this penitential season is lived out for a reason Lent is and always has been a time of preparation for the Easter season As a clear reminder of this the Church interrupts her Lenten mournfulness on Laetare Sunday to provide a brief glimpse of Easter glory The Church's motive for introducing expressions of joy on Laetare Sunday is to encourage her Children to persevere fervently to the end of this holy Season These expressions of joy are reflected in our liturgical practices today Reminiscent of the springtime of the Resurrection our barren sanctuary is at least for today filled with flowers The penitential violet of Lent is mixed with the joyful gold of Easter reflected in the rose of our vestments and adornments throughout the sanctuary And though we continue to fast from both the Gloria and Alleluia we will break from our silent recessional this weekend and lift our voices together in joy in singing a recessional hymn Our recessional hymn this weekend is the ancient Lenten classic The Glory of These Forty Days When I say ancient I truly mean it as this hymn is itself traced back to the end of the sixth century There is little dispute that this hymn was itself written by Pope St Gregory the Great the 64th successor to St Peter Named a Doctor of the Church Pope St Gregory is well known even today for his voluminous writings including many songs and hymns As this recessional hymn rings forth from our lips I encourage you to focus on its words The first verse emphasizes that our Lord Himself set the measure for our Lenten practice The next two verses highlight how this season was prefigured in the Old Testament by Moses Elijah and Daniel and prepared for in the New Testament by St John the Baptist Finally the last two verses emphasize how this Lenten season can unite us closer to the Lord Passiontide St Joseph's Day Palm Sunday Next weekend the Church enters into Passiontide Having had this brief respite of Laetare Sunday we will now focus our gaze more intently on the upcoming Passion of our Lord For this reason Passiontide makes use of that old proverb Less is more Our devotional statuary and crucifix will be veiled starting next weekend Even these things of beauty to the eyes are hidden away from us for a brief time to increase our longing for Easter Sunday Though we enter Passiontide next weekend we will leave one statue briefly unveiled Our St Joseph statue in the narthex On Tuesday March 19th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of St Joseph Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary This is one of only two celebrations that takes precedence over our Lenten season Following our parish custom we will have our St Joseph Table next weekend as it is the Sunday nearest to the actual solemnity In two weekends we will celebrate Palm Sunday Our Lord's triumphal entry into Jerusalem emphasizes the Church's entry into Holy Week As this will not only be Holy Week but also Spring Break for our school districts I encourage you to begin planning for Holy Week now especially if you will be traveling for Spring Break As this is the most important week in our entire liturgical year we do not want to let this sacred time slip us by Parish Garden Beds We had a brief taste of Spring this past week before the cold weather returned Though still some weeks away it is a good reminder that we will have four garden beds available for use behind the Church Two of the six beds will be dedicated for growing fresh flowers to be used in the sanctuary the other four beds are open for communal use If you would like to claim a bed or a part of bed for use please contact the Parish Office
