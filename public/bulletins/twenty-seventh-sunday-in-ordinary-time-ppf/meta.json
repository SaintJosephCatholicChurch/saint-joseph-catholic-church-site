  "text": "WENTY EVENTH UNDAY I RDINARY IME CTOBER 3 2021 This weekend Oct 2nd 3rd the Church celebrates the Twentyseventh Sunday in Ordinary Time The month of October is itself a month that is dedicated to the Rosary This dedication stems from the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary which is celebrated on October 7th Both on this day and throughout the whole month of October we express gratitude to the Blessed Virgin Mary for the assistance that she gives the Church in answer to the Faithful praying and mediating upon the Rosary This feast was introduced by Pope St Pius in the year 1571 AD to commemorate the miraculous victory of the Christian forces in the Battle of Lepanto on October 7 1571 Prior to the battle the greatly outnumbered forces joined those throughout the Christian world in praying the Rosary at the request of Pius The pope attributed more to the arms of the Rosary than the power of cannons and the valor of the soldiers who fought there The Rosary is itself primarily a scriptural prayer Or in the words of Pope Pius XII The Rosary is a compendium of the entire Gospel The Rosary draws its mysteries from the New Testament which are centered on the great events of our Lords Incarnation and Redemption Through the Rosary we are called to meditate with Mary upon the mysteries of Jesus Christ which she as a mother meditated on in her heart Luke 219 Throughout the month of October let us consider this beautiful prayer of the Rosary and pray it often if not daily Through it may we find a means that we too can use in order to draw closer to Jesus and Mary by meditating on the great mysteries of our salvation RAISE AND WORSHIP OLY OUR AND HOIR PDATES This coming Wednesday October 6th we will begin our first monthly Praise and Worship Holy Hour from 600 7:00PM Our choir director Teresa will help to lead music throughout the Holy Hour I invite and encourage you to join us for this musical hour of prayer before our Eucharistic Lord What is a Praise and Worship Holy Hour Our regular times of Adoration offered throughout the week are often offered in general silence This quiet atmosphere is meant to allow for time of meditation and prayer
