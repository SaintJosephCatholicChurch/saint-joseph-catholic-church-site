Joan of Arc and the first group to complete our Scavenger Hunt Anna and Audrey Many of our Saints also completed our Saints and Symbols and Name that Apparition games Scriptural Reflection for the 31st Sunday in Ordinary Time Our first reading Deut 626 comes from the Book of Deuteronomy the fifth and final book of the Torah or Pentateuch which provides Moses last account to the people of Israel as he nears the end of his life In our reading today Moses is calling Israel to remain faithful to God and His Law In verses 45 Moses expands upon the First Commandment and emphasizes how this commandment is the very basis of the entire Law The love of God is what must drive Israel and each of us in all things This is the very basis of not only the entire Law but of life itself In our Gospel today Mark 122834 our Lord returns to this passage from Deuteronomy and expands upon it as well When asked what is the greatest com mandment Jesus citing Moses words states that love of God is the first and greatest commandment But He does not stop there The second greatest commandment after love of God is love of neighbor As each of us are created in the image and likeness of God respect and love for each other is reflected as love for the Creator We cannot claim to love God and reject our neighbor and we cannot reject God and claim to love our neighbor These two commands cannot be separated but must al ways go handinhand This understanding of love of God and neighbor becomes the very basis for the Christian life Our desire for God must consume us and it must be reflected in every other relationship that we have We are called to be imitators of the Lord Ephesians 512 so much so that we allow Christ to live in and through us Galatians 220 As we enter into the Sacrifice of the Mass we are brought before the Lord Himself in the Holy Eucharist As we hear in our second reading Hebrews 72328 Jesus as High Priest is a different priesthood than the levitical priesthood At the Mass we do not simply offer gifts as a symbol of the Lords Sacrifice but we are instead united to His Sacrifice offered once for all that is His Sacrifice on the Cross We enter into this same mystery at every Mass as we are brought forward to that saving moment that is outside of time And in participating at the Sacrifice of Mass we learn from Christ Himself how we are called to imitate Him As Jesus Christ has given Himself up for us we are in turn called to give ourselves up to Him As High Priest He remains our constant intercessor and invites us to join our sacrifices to His Our gifts of bread and wine the work of our hands are brought to the altar and through the words of Christ Himself spoken by the priest ordained to serve in persona Christi Capitis in the person of Christ the Head are transformed into His Body and Blood And as we dare to approach the altar and re ceive Him in the Holy Eucharist we ourselves are to be transformed into His Body that is the Church We are called to act no longer as ourselves but as Christ We are called to unite our wills with His To be so in love with the Lord that we desire only to do those things that will bring us closer to Him How will we allow the love of God to transform us today And how will this love be shown in our love of neighbor In Christ Fr David Every day shared with the ones we love Is a gift for which we are very thankful
