  "text": "Sixth Sunday of Easter May 14 2023 Welcome home to all of our college students returning to the area for summer This weekend May 13th 14th the Church celebrates the Sixth Sunday of Easter Throughout this Eastertide our Lord continues to comfort and encourage His disciples confirm them in the faith of His resurrection and instruct them in the mysteries of His kingdom These acts prepare the disciples to not only accept and understand the glories of the Risen Christ but to be prepared to go out and preach His name to the world as they soon will This coming Thursday will mark the fortieth day since Easter Sunday when the Ascension of the Lord occurred on Mount Olivet Luke 2446 53 As our Lord ascends to the heavens He promises His disciples that He will send His spirit upon them and they will then be ready to go out and preach Traditionally known as Ascension Thursday this day is celebrated as one of the holiest days of the year In most dioceses throughout the United States this celebration is transferred to the following Sunday to allow for greater participation at Mass Our nation also marks this weekend with the celebration of Mother's Day We wish a Happy Mother's Day to all who are mothers grandmothers or godmothers or who provide motherly care to others in so many ways Mothers help to provide us with wonderful insights into what humble service and daily self sacrifice looks like Thank you for living out your vocation of motherhood Know of our love prayers and gratitude for you Throughout the month of May we also honor Mary the Mother of God On this weekend may we entrust all mothers in a special way to the prayers of Our Lady the perfect example of motherhood Mary is not only the Mother of God but given to us by her Son upon the Cross John 1926 27 becomes a mother to us all and now intercedes for us before the throne of her Son Jesus Christ Name That Bell Contest Winner After a very close vote our Name That Bell Contest Winner is St Gabriel the Archangel When returned to our campus the old church bell will now be dedicated under the patronage of this great archangel who serves as a messenger of the Lord and announces good news In the same way the bell when rung for all to hear will serve as a reminder of how we are called to announce the good news of Jesus Christ to our local community Baby Bottle Campaign Helping Hands As you leave this weekend you are invited to take a baby bottle home with you This yearly campaign helps to support Helping Hands one of our local pregnancy and family resource centers Baby bottles can be taken home and filled with change dollar bills andor checks Please make any checks payable to Helping Hands Please return the Baby Bottles either in the weekly collection basket or the Parish Office by the end of the month to support this good cause Sung Mass Parts Kyrie Eleison During the majority of the liturgical year save for Advent and Lent it has been our parish custom to recite the Kyrie Eleison Lord have mercy after the Penitential Rite and before the Gloria Starting this month we will begin to sing this short yet beautiful hymn at all weekend Masses throughout the year The choir or cantor will first sing each acclamation eg Lord have mercy which the congregation will then echo in return Lord have mercy This practice is encouraged by the General Instruction of the Roman Missal GIRM which helps to guide our approach to liturgy The GIRM describes the Kyrie Eleison as a chant by which the faithful acclaim the Lord and implore his mercy and as a chant it is usually executed by everyone that is to say with the people and the choir or cantor taking part in it GIRM Paragraph 52 Interestingly the Kyrie Eleison remains as the last remnants of Greek in the Roman Liturgy Traced back to at least the 4th Century this use serves to remind us that the Mass at Rome was originally offered in Greek which is the language of the New Testament before eventually adopting the use of Latin MASS INTENTIONS Saturday May 13 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am Confession 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Jerry King Sunday May 14 Sixth Sunday of Easter 7:10am Rosary 7:30am
