of Lent Is 431621 Phil 3814 Jn 8111 FOURTH SUNDAY OF LENT MARCH 31 2019 Today the Church celebrates the 4th Sunday of Lent or Laetare Sunday The word Laetare is Latin for Rejoice and is the first word of the Entrance Antiphon for our Mass which states Rejoice Jerusalem and all who love her Be joyful all who were in mourning exult and be satisfied at her consoling breast cf Isaiah 661011 As we approach this midpoint of Lent today serves as a reminder that though we walk now in this penitential season soon our days of fasting will give way to feasting and rejoicing For this reason the priest wears rose vestments today mixing the rich violet of Lent a penitential color with the festive gold of Easter a color of joy But as we look forward to the joy that is to come we must not lose sight of the journey that still remains This day serves as a chance to review and renew our Lenten observances of prayer fasting and almsgiving As we rejoice in what is to come and steadfast ourselves for the remainder of our Lenten journey this Sunday we will fully enter into the desert next Sunday Next Sunday will bring us to the last two weeks of Lent which is often referred to as Passion tide During this time our prayer begins to focus even more deeply on our Lords Pas sion and death We will see this reflected in the church itself as all sacred images other than our stained glass windows and the Stations of the Cross will be veiled I would also encourage each family to extend this Passiontide practice of veiling sacred images into the domestic church or our homes to enter more deeply into our liturgical life In the veiling sacred images we fast from the beauty of these devotionals to recognize that something different is happening throughout this time as we heighten our focus on the Passion narrative And as the images are veiled that means that on Easter Sunday the veils shall be removed This serves to both build upon our anticipation for Easter Sunday and act as a reminder that we journey towards the heavenly kingdom Like our Lenten journey that leads us to the joy of the resurrection our earthly life too will pass away as we reach the eternal homeland That which we see indistinctly now we will see clearly then as the veil is removed from our eyes cf 1 Corinthians 1312 Faithfully in Christ Fr David Reflection on the Fourth Sunday of Lent Fr Tommy Lane Mount St Marys Seminary There is a great search for happiness and fulfillment in life now The emphasis now is on enjoying life That search for happiness and fulfillment is symbolized by the prodigal son who went in search of happiness in the parable in todays Gospel Luke 15 The only problem was that he thought he could find happiness in what the parable calls a life of de bauchery Luke 1513 We would say now he tried to find happiness by satisfying his every desire whether moral or immoral This eventually led him to living with the pigs in the pig gery But true happiness is not to be found outside of ourselves but within ourselves in our own hearts I am sure if his father or anybody else had tried to show him before he left home that he would be wasting his life and money he would not listen He had to be left to learn the hard way from his own mistake since there was no way you could reason with him He also had to decide himself to come home If someone went to bring him home he would re sent it That younger son reminds me of the struggle of society at this time to be successful We have a booming economy but in many ways we have a spiritual famine in our country at the moment Because of that spiritual famine in some ways we have ended up like the younger son living with the pigs in the piggery We could think of the instances of drug and alcohol abuse all the fraud and stealing in the workplace murders and violence marital infi delity priestly infidelity all the rows and tensions between people Because of these and so many other things we could say we are like the younger son living with the pigs in need of returning to our Father So let us return we wont find happiness with the pigs Happiness is to be found within not outside of ourselves In the parable we are given a most beautiful description of our heavenly Father He is outside of the house waiting for the younger son to return Luke 1520 When the son returns his father runs to him clasps him in his arms kisses him brings him in and throws a party for him When we return to God he throws a party for us Not only does he come out of the house once but he comes out a second time to try to persuade the elder son to come in Luke 1528 Our heavenly Father welcomes each of us to his party The most beautiful line for me in the parable is what the father says to the elder son All I have is yours Our heav enly Father says to us All I have is yours This is a most beautiful promise and invitation We were not told at the end of the parable whether or not the elder son went in to the party Luke 1532 After reading this parable we also have a choice to make will we stay outside or will we go in to enjoy the Fathers party Far away hills look green there are many attractions in life there are many voices saying to us Follow me or Follow your desires and you will find happiness But the best offer of happiness is from God our Father All I have is yours God our heavenly Father is outside the door waiting for us to come to him When we return he runs to us clasps us in his arms and invites us into the party For the remainder of Lent we might try to make an effort to answer that invitation from our heavenly Father all I have is yours During every Mass we receive the same invitation from Jesus This is my Body which will be given up for youthis is the cup of my blood it will be shed for you Let us go into the house and enjoy Gods party WEEKEND OF APRIL 67 2019 CANTORS 500 Jay Crisp 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Mike Morrissey LECTORS 500 Knights of Columbus 730 Carol Butler 1000 Monica Harris
