WE ARE CELEBRATING LIFE GODS GIFT TO HUMANITY IT IS GODS LOVING GIFT AND CHRISTS LOVE FOR HUMANITY YES IT IS GODS LOVING GIFT TO US AND FOR US IT IS CHRISTS LOVE FOR US ALL WE NEED TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER SO THAT IN LOVE WE RISE TO EVER LASTING BLESSEDNESS DO YOU LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR AS YOU SHOULD TO LOVE IS TO ENJOY THE LIFE OF RESURREC TION HAPPY EASTER My dear brothers and sisters in Christ the Lord be with you The Resurrection the Power of Resurrection is life that is what we are celebrating today The life of love in the Resurrection when the mortal body will take immortality the corruptible body will take on incorruptibility and then we will take on glorified bodies What we are celebrating is LIFE It is not a fairy tale but a historical fact as we read in the 1st read ing Acts 1034a 3743 You must have heard about the recent happening in Judea about Jesus of Nazareth and how He went about doing good and also to the fact that they killed Him by hanging Him on a tree yet three days afterwards God raised Him to life and allowed Him to be seen by many Now we are those witnesses we ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead and He has ordered us to proclaim this to His people YOU God so loved the world that He gave His Only Be gotten Son And Christ so loved us that He gave Himself up to death death on the Cross Why so such great love It is because Christ knew that we need His help to be saved and so be able to enjoy the blessedness of God in heaven So we are called to love as God loves to love as we should How The answer is What so ever you do to the least of my people that you do unto me When I was hungry you gave me to eat when I was thirsty you gave me to drink Now enter into the home of my Father In the Gospel Jn 2019 it was this love that made Mary of Magdala to go to the tomb early in the morning and when she did not see the body of the Lord Jesus she ran to Peter The same love made Peter and the disciple the Lord loved that is John to also run to the tomb We are invited to love one another as God loves and for Gods sake and for the sake of life of blessedness If you are Mary of Magdala bring a pot of alabaster ointment If you are Peter or John run to the tomb Let me share this with you From personal experience I was in prayer of meditation thanking God for what He did for me and I asked Him what I should do for Him for His love on me He said love me and care for me in the poor and the needy To love God is to love the poor and the needy around us Help them Do not close your eyes on them Help them Whatever you give to the poor and the needy you actually reserve them for yourself in heaven Love and give so that love will be shown to you and gifts be given to you HAPPY EASTER NB The coming week is Mercy Weekend Pray for mercy and
