  "text": "Twenty Second Sunday in Ordinary Time September 3 2023 Join us on Monday September 4th for a special Labor Day Mass at 9:00AM This weekend September 2nd 3rd the Church celebrates the Twenty second Sunday in Ordinary Time This Friday September 8th the Church celebrates the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary This is one of only three birthdays celebrated on the liturgical calendar the other two being St John the Baptist and of course our Lord Dating back to at least the Fifth Century this feast day itself celebrates the dedication of a church built according to tradition over the home of St Anne the mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary Spiritually this day allows the Church to celebrate the very first rays of the dawn of redemption with the birth of the very Mother of God herself Mary was born to be the mother of the Savior of the world and through Him the spiritual mother of all men as she is given to us by her Son upon the Cross Make sure to celebrate this great feast in some way Pastoral Letter to Parish School Aged Families This past month I offered my general pastoral guidance regarding the Lifewise Academy program being allowed in our public schools I've since drafted a full letter diving into the background and reasons that led me to offer this guidance This letter is being sent to all of our registered school aged families and is now available on our parish website Please note at the request of several of our parents this letter is a bit long so as to provide a thorough review of the concerns we've found with this program Sixth Annual Day of Caring and Sharing Our parish has been asked to take the lead and help organize the sixth annual Day of Caring and Sharing This yearly event pairs volunteers from various local groups to service projects that support a wide range of needs within our community Our Knights of Columbus have participated annually in this event and are now taking on a leadership role to help ensure that it continues for years to come Sign up sheets for the various projects are out in the narthex The day itself is actually three days running from Sept 14th through Sept 16th and helps to provide for the needs of many local charities including the Boys and Girls Club Hannah's House and Forgotten Children If you are able to volunteer for any of the projects I encourage you to do so This is a wonderful way to give back and show our parish's support to our local community Updates on Schooling and Work within our Tribunal Recently I've been asked a number of times if I have completed my studies At the moment I've completed all coursework and finished all necessary exams including the canonical equivalent of the Bar Exam I am still however working on my thesis Given my responsibilities to both our parish and our diocesan Tribunal I've had to moderate the amount of time I can put towards research and writing Yet I am still on track to finish my thesis this fall Once I complete my thesis I will most likely be appointed as a judge within our Tribunal system It is my hope though that I can first serve at least for a short time as one of our Defenders of the Bond This position serves in the Tribunal as an independent third party within every annulment proceeding and argues for the validity of the marriage Serving in this position will allow me the opportunity to gain greater insight into the full workings of our Tribunal system In addition to my current role as an advocate in our Tribunal I am also starting to take the show on the road Working together with our Tribunal staff we are preparing a number of presentations for priests and parish staff to be given throughout the diocese in September and October These presentations will help train priests and parish staff to better assist and accompany parishioners who are currently going through the marriage nullity process As these presentations will be offered during the day they will not affect our general parish schedule
