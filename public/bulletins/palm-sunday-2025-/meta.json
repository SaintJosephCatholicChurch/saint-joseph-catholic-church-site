241 12 Palm Sunday of the Passion of the Lord April 13 2025 This weekend April 12th13th the Church celebrates Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion Joining with the crowds in Jerusalem we greet the Lord with palm branches held high Though His enemies are focused on His destruction today is a day of triumph for the Lord entering into Jerusalem He who is to be nailed to the cross is first proclaimed as King by the people of the great city and greeted with cries that echo Hosannas to the Son of David This triumphant entry into the holy city was first prophesied by Zechariah to Israel returned from exile Exult greatly daughter Zion Shout for joy daughter Jerusalem Behold your king is coming to you a just savior is he humble and riding on a donkey on a colt the foal of a donkey Zech 99 The hour is coming and is now here as the prophecies are fulfilled and we usher in together this great week known simply as Holy Week Our Holy Week Schedule is this weekend's bulletin cover I encourage and invite you to enter into this week of prayer as much as you are able most especially throughout the Sacred Paschal Triduum As a reminder outside of the many opportunities we will have for prayer together as a parish throughout this whole week the Church itself remains open at all hours for private prayer special Thank You to all those who joined us for the informational presentation regarding parish renovations last weekend With nearly fifty people in attendance we had the opportunity to hear a presentation from Bill Heyer our lead architect looking at the various rules that help guide church architecture Following his presentation we then had an opportunity for a number of insightful questions and great discussions As of this weekend our renderings have received approval from our diocesan Sacred Art and Architecture Committee This committee will forward their recommendation to Bishop Rhoades for his approval Once we receive Bishop's approval we will be able to move forward with design development and commission construction documents both of which are necessary steps before we can begin discussions and quoting bids with general contractors In addition to this committee we have also prepared a presentation for our Diocesan Finance Council that reviews the financial scope of the project Though we had hoped to present to the council this month the presentation has been delayed till next month for scheduling purposes This council helps to ensure that parishes are being financially responsible on projects throughout the diocese and offers support and guidance throughout this entire process The Chrism Mass at the Cathedral Have you ever attended the Chrism Mass It is the annual celebration of the institution of the priesthood one of the two principal mysteries of Holy Thursday along of course with the institution of the Eucharist At the Chrism Mass the Bishop consecrates the Sacred Chrism the oil used for the ordination of priests anointing after Baptism and for Confirmation He also blesses the Oil of the Sick and the Oil of Catechumens These oils will be sent out to the parishes of the diocese and presented to each parish at the Mass of the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday for use throughout the year In addition to the blessing of oils it is also the evening on which the priests of the diocese renew our priestly promises It is truly a unique and beautiful Mass If you have never attended before I encourage you to do so Tuesday April 15th at 7 PM at the Cathedral in Fort Wayne Sacred Paschal Triduum At the Mass of the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday the Church enters into the Sacred Paschal Triduum At the end of this Mass there is no closing blessing No blessing is given again until the close of the Easter Vigil In this way the three days from Holy Thursday to Holy Saturday are united as one continuous liturgy as we spend this time with the Lord Just as quickly as these days have come so will they pass Let us truly enter into this sacred time Weekend of April 19th 20th Easter Vigil Easter Sunday 9:00pm Adult Choir 7:30am Donna Geisel 10:00am Children's Choir 9:00pm Mike Dunn Volunteer 7:30am Barb Ault 10:00am Bruce
