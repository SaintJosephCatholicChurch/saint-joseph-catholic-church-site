Cor 12411 Jn 2111 THE BAPTISM OF THE LORD SUNDAY JANUARY 13 2019 YEAR Today marks the end of the Christmas season as we celebrate of the Baptist of the Lord Starting Monday we will enter into the First Week of Ordinary Time Though we move onward from the Christmas season we must allow the joy of the Christ child to remain alive in our hearts That grace manifested in the Incarnation of Jesus Christ continues to work within our lives and inwardly moves us to seek holiness Our readings this weekend continue the theme of manifestation begun last week on the Epiphany of the Lord As the star arose and made known Jesus presence to the Magi today as Jesus is baptized in the Jordan the trinitarian relationship of God as Father Son and Holy Spirit is made known to us And as it has been made known to us we are now invited into that same relationship through our baptism The words spoken to the Lord today by God the Father are spoken to each of us when we are baptized That we are Gods beloved children with whom He is well pleased Our baptismal day should be one we remember each year as we do our birthday For on the day of our baptism we were reborn again and made anew in Jesus Christ The grace of our baptism never fades Instead it will be a light of Jesus Christ that shines brightly in and through our lives if only we allow it too May we strive to live out our baptismal dignity each and every day of our lives Parish Projects Updates As we enter into this new year we wanted to provide ongoing updates regarding the several projects currently underway in the parish Having received several bids and the approval of our various parish committees our Parking Lot Project has been submitted to the Diocesan Buildings and Improve ments Committee for review This committee consists of building and construction experts who advise the 81 parishes in our diocese regarding all major projects Once we receive the committees decision we will be able to move forward with the needed repairs Thanks to your generous response to the Annual Bishops Appeal we are prepared to move forward with our Church Security Project We will be approaching this project in three phases Phase 1 Surveillance System Phase 2 Security Doors Phase 3 Improved InteriorExterior Lighting We are currently moving forward with Phase 1 and will soon have security cameras installed to monitor the entrances to both the Church and Parish Offices Planning is currently underway for Phases 2 and 3 Finally responding to a suggestion from our Comment Box in the narthex we hope to soon make available several assisted listening devices for individual use during our liturgies These individual units will be available to those with hearing difficul ties and will serve to amplify the sound system from the Church Trying to be good financial stewards with that which you have entrusted us we are striving to work with local businesses to complete these parish projects This allows us to not only improve our parish but also support the growth of our local commu nity As we conclude the Christmas Season I wanted to once more offer a special Thank You to all those who worked diligently throughout the Advent and Christmas sea sons to ensure that our Church and our liturgies gave great glory to God Fr David All mortal sins are to be submitted to the keys of the Church and all can be for given but recourse to these keys is the only the necessary and the certain way to forgiveness Unless those who are guilty of grievous sin have recourse to the power of the keys they cannot hope for eternal salvation Open your lips then and confess your sins to the priest St Augustine Christian Combat AD 397 Saint Monica model of patience prayer and perseverance intercede for us
