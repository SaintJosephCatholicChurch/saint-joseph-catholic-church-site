  "text": "Seventeenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 24 2022 Next weekend will be Fr John's last weekend with us We thank him for his attentive care of our parish over the past many weekends and ask God's blessings upon his future ministry This weekend July 23rd 24th the Church celebrates the Seventeenth Sunday in Ordinary Time In our readings this weekend we continue with our focus on prayer In the Gospel reading Luke 111 13 having been taught the Our Father we are reminded of the importance of persistence in prayer and the effectiveness of prayer itself The Lord calls us into a conversation and a relationship with Him We must now ask ourselves how often we respond to that call and turn to the Lord in prayer each day As it was named last year by Pope Francis this weekend is also known as the World Day for Grandparents and the Elderly Falling nearest to the Feast of Sts Joachim and Anne the parents of Mary and grandparents of Jesus we are reminded of the great gift that are our grandparents and the elderly members of our families Their witness to us and presence with us serve as a gift for families for society and for the whole Church Writing to grandparents and the elderly on this day Pope Francis reminds us of the power of prayer Through their daily prayer grandparents can become artisans of the revolution of tenderness in our world So often we do not truly recognize the power found in and through prayer In the words of the Ho ly Father Our trustful prayer can do a great deal it can accompany the cry of pain of those who suffer and it can help change hearts It was my prayer that those participating in or attending the Wells County 4 Fair this past week had a wonderful time special Congratulations to all of our parishioners who took home awards over this past week from the Fair Following Fair weekend as is our parish custom you can expect the St Joseph Giving Table to be going up in the Narthex soon Our yearly St Joseph Giving Table serves as a place to share any extra produce from your gardens each weekend so that nothing goes to waste Speaking of gardens our six garden boxes behind the Church are getting good use Four of the garden boxes were spoken for by parishioners and when I saw them in June their gardens appear to be coming in quite well The remaining two boxes have been serving as flower beds to provide fresh cut flowers for use in the Church special Thank You to parishioner Louise Mayer for her hard work and green thumb caring for these two flower beds This Tuesday July 26th the Indiana General Assembly will continue with a special session that was initially convened on July 6th While the assembly will be dealing with inflation and what to do with the state's budget surplus serious issues in themselves they will also be addressing the question of what our state will do regarding the regulation of abortion and the protection of unborn human lives As mentioned just a few weeks ago the Supreme Court's decision on Dobbs overturned both Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey This decision has returned the authority to regulate abortion back to each individual state Part of the assembly's schedule this week then will be to look at two bills one addressing abortion regulations in Indiana and the other on providing support to expecting mothers Following in the exhortation of St Paul to St Timothy in 1 Timothy 21 2 may we pray and fast fervently this week for our civil leaders approaching this special assembly The battle to protect and safeguard human life at all stages from conception to natural death and at every moment in between is far from over In everything that we do we are called to be witnesses to the culture of life May our prayer and daily charitable work always reflect this MASS INTENTIONS
