  "text": "IXTEENTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME ULY 18 2021 This week we welcomed our four Totus Tuus missionaries to lead our summer youth program Some moments of fun from throughout the week are captured on this weekends bulletin cover special Thank You to Michelle in the Parish Office for her hard work in program planning and to all those who volunteered for our Totus Tuus program It was a great week of prayer activities fraternity and learning for our youth We are already beginning to plan for next years date Coming Soon St Joseph Catholic Cemetery Nearly two years ago one of our monthly discussion forums provided a variety of information on endoflife care and funeral planning At that forum I mentioned several discussions that had been ongoing regarding the creation of a Catholic cemetery here in Bluffton preceding even my arrival at St Josephs Many individuals stated that there would be an interest if a Catholic cemetery was created At the end of this month that discussion will begin to take physical form Ground will soon be excavated to begin work on St Joseph Catholic Cemetery along IN124 Working with Jeff and Jaime Lehmler of locallyowned ThomaRich Lehmler Funeral Home our parish has been offered the chance to create a Catholic cemetery This cemetery will be located alongside the existing Elm Grove Cemetery on IN124 We have received approval from the diocese to move forward with this joint venture and as of two weeks ago from the local Bluffton Cemetery board With this dualapproval an undeveloped portion of Elm Grove Cemetery has now been set apart to take shape and become St Joseph Catholic Cemetery What is a Catholic cemetery Catholic cemetery is a sacred area with blessed ground that has been set apart as a place of prayer for our beloved deceased When a person is buried outside of a Catholic cemetery the priest blesses the individual grave as a part of the committal ceremony at the graveside Often a Catholic cemetery will also have both statuary and monuments that serve as a visual reminder of our faith in Jesus Christ and the resurrection of the body It is my hope that as we move forward with this project our parish family will provide the cemetery with an outdoor altar This will allow us on special occasions such as All Souls Day to gather together and celebrate the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass surrounded by and for our beloved deceased who are now awaiting the resurrection of the body This is of course a spiritual work of mercy To pray for the dead In addition to this spiritual work of mercy we can also use this newfound opportunity to focus on the corporal work of mercy of burying the dead One way that this can be accomplished is for our parish to set aside plots for those who have no one to bury them Those plots can then be made available to offer a proper burial for such individuals This is just one of many ways that we can seek to perform such works of mercy as a parish family In the coming weeks and months we will be working with Jeff Lehmler to put together informational packets regarding the cemetery These packets will include how to purchase plots in the cemetery if and how existing plots in other local cemeteries may be transferred to St Joseph Catholic Cemetery and a variety of other useful information We are also planning to hold informational sessions in the Parish Social Hall for those who are interested in learning more in the foreseeable future Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday July 17 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm
