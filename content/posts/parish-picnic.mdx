<p>On <strong>Saturday, October 5th</strong>, we will celebrate our annual <strong>Parish Picnic</strong>!</p>
<p>We will begin our celebration gathering for the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass at 5 PM in the Church. Our celebration will continue with a meal in the Parish Social Hall following Mass and our 2nd Annual Chili Cook-Off.</p>
<p>After our meal, there will be a variety of events ongoing, including games for children and adults, and an Open House Tour of the Rectory from 7-7:30 PM. I look forward to this wonderful opportunity for parish fellowship and hope to see you there!</p>
