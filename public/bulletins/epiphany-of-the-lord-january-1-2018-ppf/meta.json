Becky Biberstein Fern Britton James Yonker Sr Eve lyn Morrissey Betty Meyer Ron Payne David Carr Ronnie Bonnie Burns Michael Green Dorothy Dottie Marbach and Rick Cotterman Homily of His Holiness Pope Francis Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord 6 January 2015 That child born in Bethlehem of the Virgin Mary came not only for the people of Israel represented by the shepherds of Bethlehem but also for all humanity represented today by the wise men from the East It is on the Magi and their journey in search of the Messiah that the Church today invites us to meditate and to pray These wise men from the East were the first in that great procession of which the prophet Isaiah spoke in todays first reading cf 6016 a procession which from that time on has continued uninterrupted in every age it hears the message of the star and finds the Child who reveals the tenderness of God New persons are always be ing enlightened by that star they find the way and come into his presence According to tradition the wise men were sages watchers of the constellations observers of the heavens in a cultural and religious context which saw the stars as having significance and power over human affairs The wise men represent men and woman who seek God in the worlds religions and philosophies an unending quest The wise men point out to us the path of our journey through life They sought the true Light As a liturgical hymn of Epiphany which speaks of their experience puts it Lumen requirunt lumine by following a light they sought the light They set out in search of God Having seen the sign of the star they grasped its message and set off on a long journey It is the Holy Spirit who called them and prompted them to set out during their journey they were also to have a personal encounter with the true God Along the way the wise men encountered many difficulties Once they reached Jerusalem they went to the palace of the king for they thought it obvious that the new king would be born in the royal palace There they lost sight of the star and met with a temptation placed there by the devil it was the deception of Herod King Herod was interested in the child not to worship him but to eliminate him Herod is the powerful man who sees others only as rivals Deep down he also considers God a rival indeed the most dangerous rival of all In Herods palace the wise men ex perience a moment of obscurity of desolation which they manage to overcome thanks to the prompting of the Holy Spirit who speaks through the prophecies of sacred Scripture These indicate that the Messiah is to be born in Bethlehem the city of David At that point they resume their journey and once more they see the star the evan gelist says that they rejoiced exceedingly Mt 210 Coming to Bethlehem they found the child with Mary his mother Mt 211 After that of Jerusalem this was their second great temptation to reject this smallness But instead they fell down and worshiped him offering him their precious symbolic gifts Again it is the grace of the Holy Spirit which assists them That grace which through the star had called them and led them along the way now lets them enter into the mystery Led by the Spirit they come to realize that Gods criteria are quite different from those of men that God does not manifest himself in the power of this world but speaks to us in the humbleness of his love The wise men are thus models of conversion to the true faith since they believed more in the goodness of God than in the apparent splendour of power And so we can ask ourselves what is the mystery in which God is hidden Where can I find him All around us we see wars the exploitation of children torture traf ficking in arms trafficking in persons In all these realities in these the least of our brothers and sisters who are enduring these difficult situations there is Jesus cf Mt 254045 The crib points us to a different path from the one cherished by the thinking of this world it is the path of Gods selfabasement his glory concealed in the manger of Bethlehem on the cross upon Calvary in each of our suffering broth ers and sisters The wise men entered into the mystery They passed from human calculations to the mystery this was their conversion And our own Let us ask the Lord to let us undergo that same journey of conversion experienced by the wise men Let us ask him to protect us and to set us free from the temptations which hide the star To let us always feel the troubling question Where is the star whenever amid the de ceptions of this world we lose sight of it To let us know ever anew Gods mystery and not to be scandalized by the sign which points to a babe wrapped in swad dling clothes lying in a manger Lk 212 and to have the humility to ask the Mother our Mother to show him to us To find the courage to be liberated from our illusions our presumptions our lights and to seek this courage in the humility of faith and in this way to encounter the Light Lumen like
