in Ordinary Time October 26 2025 This weekend October 25th 26th the Church celebrates the Thirtieth Sunday in Ordinary Time Entering into the last four weeks of Ordinary Time our readings seemingly become more bleak as the liturgical year draws to an end Next weekend will even appropriately continue this theme as we celebrate the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed and our readings are taken from those prepared for the Mass of Christian Burial This bleakness however is not meant to fill us with darkness but light In recognizing the fallenness of man and the pain of death we are to be shaken free from any hold of this passing world and reminded of eternity This is why these coming weeks as sullen as they might be ultimately culminate in the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe To quote that proverb first attributed to Thomas Fuller It is darkest before the dawn Consecration to St Joseph As we near the end of our 150th Parish Anniversary we are approaching a pivotal moment for our parish family To end our celebrations I invite you to participate in our upcoming parish wide 33 Day Consecration to St Joseph our parish patron In an act of consecration we give ourselves to Jesus Christ by committing ourselves to respond to His grace through the guidance and care of a particular Saint or in this instance St Joseph In learning about the life of St Joseph we learn about the virtues that make him a just man Matthew 119 In placing ourselves in his care we imitate the Lord Himself who likewise entrusted Himself to the care and guidance of St Joseph as His foster father We will begin our preparation on the weekend of November 8th 9th and conclude with the public Act of Consecration at the end of our parish Forty Hours Devotion on December 10th In preparation we will use the Consecration to St Joseph by Fr Donald Calloway MIC This work offers 33 days of reflections on the various titles associated with St Joseph from the Litany of St Joseph Each reflection is itself only two pages while also providing additional material for further reflection if desired Finally each day concludes with praying the Litany of St Joseph General Campus Maintenance In addition to the current maintenance on our pews we've had several other projects recently completed on our campus This past summer the portico in front of our main church doors was accidently damaged when a vehicle over the clearance height attempted to drive underneath Ron Banter Plastering of Poneto was able to repair the damage and repaint the portico this past week At the end of September Dunwiddie Heating AC Plumbing performed bi annual maintenance on our heating system in anticipation of the cold Much to my personal dismay everything was in good order and our heating system is now turned on Finally a team from Felger Electric led by parishioner Andy Vachon wired our Archangel Gabriel bell in front of the Church which now wonderfully rings out the Angelus hours throughout the week special Thank You to all those who assisted with these projects Celebration of All Saints and Commemoration of All Souls As a reminder the Solemnity of All Saints is not a holy day of obligation this year as it falls on a Saturday We can still view it however as a holy day of opportunity to assist at Mass in celebration of the Saints in heaven We will offer two Masses this Saturday November 1st at 8:00AM and 11:00AM for the Solemnity of All Saints Following the 11:00AM Mass join us in the Parish Social Hall for our annual All Saints Day Party and Potluck Falling on Sunday the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed will take precedence over Ordinary Time this year In addition to our normal weekend Mass schedule Saturday Vigil at 5:00PM Sunday at 7:30AM and 10:00AM we will offer an additional Mass on Sunday November 2nd outside at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery at 1:00PM All are welcome to join us as we continue to pray for our dearly departed loved ones
