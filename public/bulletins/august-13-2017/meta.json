David Carr Ronnie Bonnie Burns Mi chael Green and Dorothy Dottie Marbach 19Th SUNDAY ORDINARY TIME AUGUST 13 2017 YR HAVE PATIENCE PRAY AND HOPE GOD WILL HELP My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all Human life is full of smiles and tears We have our ups and downs in life We attend both weddings and funerals Parents experience and witness graduations and failures of their children Married life can be like the smell of roses and can also turn into a nightmare Young people are successful today and tomorrow suffer failures You can feel disappointed by the government or even by the Church All this may leave us confused What shall we do Are we to give up our faith in God No We must keep going Let us borrow a leaf from what Elijah did when queen Jezebel threaten his life He kept still faith in God prayed and ran for his dear life Thus in the 1st Reading 1 Kgs 199a 1113a Elijah confronted the false prophets of Baal the god Jezebel worshiped He took a stand in truth against Queen Jezebel without fear Thus he lost the favor of Jezebel and Jezebel wanted to kill him He ran to God for protection Even with God he experienced difficulties Listen to what happened when he ran to God for protection on the mountain of God There was a mighty wind that shattered the rocks There was earthquake And there was wild fire God was not in any of those happenings These can be compared in our life when we are in trouble we feel the absence of God Then came the gentle breeze There was God Prayer and per severance is necessary for success in life for all of us In the 2nd reading Rom 915St Paul assured us that we are really adopted sons and daughters of God God promised us salvation if we keep faith and trust in Him dif ficulties notwithstanding We must bless God in all circumstances And in the gospel Mt 142233 he apostles were in trouble with the wind in the sea against their boat Jesus came walking on the sea They though it was a ghost They shouted because of fear for they thought it was a ghost Also they shouted because according to their belief noise scaresdrives away ghosts But Jesus said do not be afraid it is me And Peter said to Him if it is you command me to come to you over the water Jesus said come Peter stepped out of the boat with faith and walked on the water When he experienced the splashes of water on himself he was afraid and at once he started drowning He cried out for help and Jesus stretched out his hand and saved him We can put what happened into singing so listen to what Jesus said Come to me over the water Peter walk on the waves of the storming sea I know your best in trail and fragile but believe in me Elijah was in trouble at the mountain of Horeb Peter was in trouble with the other dis ciples on the sea All of them Elijah Peter and the disciples got help because they prayed trusted and had faith We can be faced with some of these trouble in life They can come our way It can come from your childchildren your wife your husband your petpets your coworker or even from yourself It can be sickness jobless financial difficulties disappointment from people name them What you need to do is to be patient If it is from your children love them teach them train them speak to them encourage them Children listen to your parents Do you hear me When it is from the others do your best to pray to love them dialogue with them cope with them pray for them and for yourself In prayer God assured us of His Help and Support in times of trials and tribulations if we turn to Him for help Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 We are organizing Marriage Encounter Parish Based On the weekend of Oct 20 to 22 2017
