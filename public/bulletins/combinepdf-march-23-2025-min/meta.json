Jn 91 41 Third Sunday of Lent March 23 2025 This weekend March 22nd 23rd the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Lent Over the next three weekends we will invite forward our five Catechumens and Candidates for Full Communion to participate in the Lenten Scrutinies These ancient rites first mentioned by St Ambrose of Milan in the fourth century call forth those preparing to enter the Church as we pray that they might be enlightened by the Word and grace of God Since at least the seventh century the Gospel readings from Year of our three year lectionary cycle have been associated with the Scrutinies As such we will deviate from our Year readings over the next three weekends so that we might hear these ancient readings from Year Each of the three Gospel readings offer a form of catechesis about the full nature of and the shattering consequences of sin and our need for Jesus Christ St Joseph Day Table This past Wednesday the Church celebrated the Solemnity of St Joseph Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary In honor of our parish patron we will once again have the St Joseph Table available in the narthex after all Masses As is our parish custom help yourself to a treat in honor of St Joseph this weekend and may his example of faith and humility inspire us all Parish Renovation Update Rendering Edition Earlier this week I had the opportunity to sit down with Bishop Rhoades and review drawings for our upcoming renovations with him He was excited with what he saw and I am very excited to now be able to share our first official rendering with you this weekend This rendering takes into account the various needs we identified at the beginning of this project including updated flooring increased seating capacity and revised placement of our statuary The proposed snapshot rendering of the Church offers a reimagining of the wood slatting alongside the back wall of our sanctuary Shortening the wood slatting it would take on the form of a wainscoting This will allow stencil work along the back wall to help draw our focus inward better highlighting the tabernacle the crucifix and our central stained glass window The renderings also include a number of practical updates for accessibility and safety such as legs to stabilize the main altar a sturdy devotional rail for handrails and wider steps for enteringexiting the sanctuary and shortening the width of the sanctuary so that devotional candles are on floor level next to our statuary Plus there is the addition of increased devotional space which can be dedicated to our local blessed Bl Solanus Casey special Thank You to our Parish and Finance Councils and all who joined us at our monthly Parish Council meetings for their invaluable insights and guidance to help bring our renovation project to this point Our next step includes holding an Informational Session for the parish with our lead architect Bill Heyer This Informational Session will be on Sunday April 6th at 6:00PM in the Church This session will begin with a formal presentation of the proposed rendering and highlight various elements of the project After this presentation we will open the floor for questions and discussion From this evening Bill and his team will continue their work on renderings which will eventually take the shape of construction designs to help guide our contractors once work begins Regarding our proposed timeline we had hoped to be ready for construction this summer As of this moment we still have several diocesan committees that we need approval from before we are able to move forward I am ever grateful for your patience as we work through the diocesan approval process to ensure every detail of this project reflects our parish's vision and needs Please keep this project in your prayers as we take the next steps toward bringing these renovations to life As this is the first major renovation in our church building itself in 45 years we want to make sure that everything is done properly and that ultimately all that we do is done for the glory of God Weekend of March 29th 30th 500 Mike Morrissey 730 David Smith 1000 Jay Crisp 500 Dan Geimer 730 Bruce Holland 1000 Jacque
