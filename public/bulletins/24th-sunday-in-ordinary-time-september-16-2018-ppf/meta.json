during this pilgrimage please email your intentions to me at <a href=\"frdavidvioligmail.com\">frdavidvioligmail.com</a> Though our Lord offered hope to His chosen people last week in our first reading they have continued to complain against and doubt Him In re sponse the author of our first reading Isaiah 5059 now speaks as the ser vant of the Lord and describes the long awaited Messiah The prophet reas sures Israel of Gods fidelity to His people even though they themselves have been found unfaithful time and time again The Messiah who is to come to save Israel exemplifies obedience to God an obedience that Israel itself is called to Like Israel suffering exile the Servant of the Lord will suffer many great injustices and hardships Unlike Israel however the Servant of the Lord will not falter in following after the Lord Instead He will remain faithful as the Lord is Himself always faithful The treatment that the Servant of the Lord faces in Isaiah is one that mirrors the treatment that Jesus will face on the Cross The Sanhedrin even reference this same passage of Isaiah as they strike and hurl abuse at our Lord Matthew 266768 Parallels such as this is a form of Scripture reading called typology Typology is when an Old Testament personevent foreshadows a greater personevent in the New Testament The former is a type of the lat ter In this way the Servant of the Lord in Isaiah is a foreshadowing or type of Jesus The prophet reveals something of the Messiah and how He is to be treat that we see fulfilled in the Gospels All things especially the Old Testa ment prophecies point us always to Jesus Christ Pointing us towards Jesus we must now turn to our Gospel reading for today Mark 82735 Our Lord recognizes that the people seeking Him out do not yet fully understand that He is the Messiah For this reason He asks His disciples this most important question Who do you say that I am Simon Peter our first Pope boldly answers for the group acknowledging Jesus as the Christ Jesus proceeds to describe the suffering He will endure as the Servant of the Lord and challenges those who wish to follow Him to be pre pared to follow Him in all things including carrying the Cross To be a disci ple one who follows after Jesus is no easy task Instead it is one that must challenge each of us throughout our entire lives In this way the Gospel mes sage will be preached not only in our words but through the testimony of our very lives As St James says in our second reading James 21418 we dem onstrate our faith in Jesus to the world from our works Our faith compels us to act and our actions testify loudly to our faith How will we today show that we like St Peter and the Apostles recognize Jesus as the Christ Will lives our very actions in this day reflect the faith we hold in our hearts In Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF September 2223 2018 CANTORS 500 Larry Leitz 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Jay Crisp LECTORS 500 Ginny Fenstermaker 730 Barb
