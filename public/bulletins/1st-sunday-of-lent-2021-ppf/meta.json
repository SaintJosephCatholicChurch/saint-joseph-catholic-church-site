  "text": "IRST UNDAY OF ENT EBRUARY 21 2021 Having entered into this holy and penitential season with the celebration of Ash Wednesday the Church celebrates the First Sunday of Lent this weekend February 20th 21st Our Gospel reading Mark 11215 entering into these forty days speak of Jesus own forty days in the desert His forty days serve to sum up in His person the forty years which Israel spent in the wilderness moving from slavery to the Promised Land In the same way these forty days of Lent provide the form for our own facing of temptation with the spiritual weapons of prayer fasting and almsgiving The whole season of Lent is to serve as an intense moment of the Churchs penitential practice As described in the Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraph 1438 this season is one p articularly appropriate for spiritual exercises penitential liturgies pilgrimages as signs of penance voluntary self denial such as fasting and almsgiving and fraternal sharing charitable and missionary works It is to serve as a reminder that we are in a spiritual battle Or as we hear from Job 71 Is not life on earth warfare In this spiritual warfare we fight against temptation and sin Through our spiritual weapons of prayer fasting and almsgiving we grow in our disciplines and the spiritual life so that we may not be overcome Hebrews 12113 Though we may falter throughout our Lenten journey take heart and do not allow yourself to be overwhelmed When we feel overwhelmed we turn to the loving arms of our Saviour and find rest Matthew 1128 30 And in His rest we find the strength to pick up our cross and continue along this Lenten journey Luke 92327 For through faith we know that God is watching over us as he did over his Beloved Son in the Desert The Lord desires to use this Lenten season to bring us even closer to Him This is a journey however that takes time It is a journey that moves little by little each and everyday of the Lenten season And as so often happens its a journey that may seem very different than what we had planned But the Lord will work in each moment if we only let Him May we be open to the workings of the Spirit this Lenten season ANON AW AND CHOOL PDATES Several have recently asked how my studies with Canon Law have been going since I havent given an update since last semester This past Fall semester I completed the last of the language requirements needed for the licentiate which is the degree I am working towards so the remainder of my classes are now fully focused on the law itself Having started the Spring semester I am currently taking a class in Ordained Ministry which looks specifically at how the canons relate to deacons priests and bishops I am also beginning to narrow down topics for my dissertation which will be due in the Summer of 2022 The School of Canon Law is still trying to determine what our Summer semester will look like either taking place in person at Catholic University in Washington DC or taking place entirely online Regardless of the format I will be taking four courses this summer Religious Liberty Teaching Office Sanctions and Temporal Goods In addition to my studies at Catholic University Ive recently taken advantage of a program offered by our diocese and am now also working towards a Certificate in Church Management from Villanova University This yearlong seminar offers insight into and advice for parish administration Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday February 20 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm Confessions 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Victoria Rios Sunday February 21
