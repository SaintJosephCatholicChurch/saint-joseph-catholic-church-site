  "text": "Dedication of a Church Twelfth Sunday in Ordinary Time June 25 2023 This weekend June 24th25th the universal Church celebrates the Twelfth Sunday in Ordinary Time Additionally our local parish Church celebrates the fifty seventh anniversary of the dedication of our church building Having moved from the old church building on Cherry Street our current building was dedicat ed on June 26 1966 by Bishop Leo Pursley the sixth bishop of our diocese Though our readings will be taken from the Twelfth Sunday in Ordinary Time the prayers of the Mass will come from the Common of the Dedication of a Church on the Anniversary of the Dedication The importance of this day marked as a solemnity for our parish was perhaps most aptly described by our eighth pastor Fr Bob Traub in the fundraising materials for the new building This building will serve as a testimony to our story the vibrant epic of the way in which the life of God is nourished in our souls It begins with the first blessing sought by the expectant mother for her newly conceived child and ends only with the last benediction begged by grieving families for their departed loved ones During all the years in between filled with work and rest joy and sorrow pleasure and pain the Altar is the center of our attention Our freely offered sacrifices at this time will be recognition of the value we place upon our supernatural life and our desire for it to grow stronger in St Joseph Parish Mission Appeal The Archdiocese of Tabora in Tanazia Next weekend we welcome Fr Andrew Mlele as mission speaker Fr Mlele will be speaking about and raising funds to support our brothers and sisters in his home Archdiocese of Tabora in Tanzania This annual appeal is coordinated by our diocese with the Propagation of the Faith which seeks to increase awareness of and financial support for mission dioceses around the world Fr Mlele is currently visiting the United States while on summer break from pursuing his doctorate in Rome During this visit he is speaking to help raise funds 1 for the education and protection of orphans children and those who suffer from albinism and are persecuted in Tanzania and 2 for improvements to the local communities water and sanitation systems Supporting these causes we can help those in the Archdiocese of Tabora Fr Mlele will preach at all of our Masses next weekend An additional basket will be out for donations to support this good cause The majority of the funds raised will be sent to the Archdiocese of Tabora Note 10 of this collection is retained by our diocese to fund our local Office of the Pontifical Mission which serves to organize this annual appeal Thank you for your generosity DID YOU KNOW THE SA CRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION Just as Baptism gives new life the Eucharist nourishes life and Confession restores life when it is broken Confirmation strengthens that same life by the gifts of the Holy Spirit This Sacrament serves to strengthen that grace which God has given and continues to give to His children cf CCC 1285 1302 1303 and offers those who receive it the strength to be a true witness of Christ Confirmation helps a person remain faithful to their baptismal commitment to witness to Christ and to serve others The gifts of the Holy Spirit associated with Confirmation are strengths or virtues that Christian living requires if it is to be fruitful and complete Thus wisdom understanding knowledge fortitude piety counsel and fear of the Lord are divine aids to Christian living without which fulfilling one's baptismal calling would be far more difficult if not impossible In Confirmation the outward sign is the laying on of hands with the Sacred Chrism by the Bishop or priest signifying the spiritual grace of receiving the fulness of the gifts of the Holy Spirit It is instituted by Christ when He speaks of the coming of the Holy Spirit John 1415 26 and shown in practice when Peter and John traveled to Samaria and laid hands upon the baptized Samaritans to impart the Holy Spirit Acts 814 18 In receiving the Holy Spirit through this Sacrament we are given the grace to share more completely in Jesus mission Correction The Corpus
