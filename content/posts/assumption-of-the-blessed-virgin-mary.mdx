<p>This Thursday, August 15th, is a Holy Day of Obligation as we celebrate the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>
<h3>Mass Times for the Holy Day</h3>

<p>On this day, the Church celebrates Mary, the Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, being taken up, body and soul, into heaven. This ancient teaching of Christ&rsquo;s Church, prefigured in both Enoch (Gen. 5:24; Hebrews 11:5) and Elijah (2 Kings 2:11), sees God&rsquo;s work in Mary brought to completion here on earth as she is brought into eternity. It is a day worth celebrating as it gives us joyful hope that we, too, may follow Mary&rsquo;s path that points us always to her Son, Jesus, and to His Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
