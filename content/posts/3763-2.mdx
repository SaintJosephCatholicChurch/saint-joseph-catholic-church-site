<p>Join us <strong>Sunday, Oct. 13th, between the 7:30 and 10 AM Masses in the Social Hall&nbsp;</strong>or <strong>Wendesday, Oct. 16th, following the 7 PM Wednesday evening Mass in the Social Hall&nbsp;</strong>for our monthly discussion forum series.&nbsp; <strong>For October, our discussion forum will focus on:</strong> <strong>The Saints</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a very important topic to understand in our Faith as there are so many misconceptions about our relationships with the Saints (&ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t Catholics worship Saints?</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Aren&rsquo;t Statues and Images of the Saints a form of idolatry?</em>&rdquo; etc&hellip;). In better understanding and fostering our relationships with the Saints, we are able to grow even deeper in our relationship with the Lord. All are welcome to join us.</p>
