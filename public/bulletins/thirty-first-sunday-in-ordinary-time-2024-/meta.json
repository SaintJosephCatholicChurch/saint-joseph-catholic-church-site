1710 16 Ps 1467 10 Heb 924 28 Mk 1238 44 or 2141 44 Thirty First Sunday in Ordinary Time November 3 2024 This weekend Nov 2nd 3rd the Church celebrates the Thirty first Sunday in Ordinary Time Nearing the end of our liturgical year our focus is ever more so clearly on the centrality of Jesus for our salvation Recognizing Jesus as our Savior we must ask ourselves if we maintain an intimate communion with Him on a daily basis through prayer and the Sacraments We are called to enter into this relationship with the Lord each and everyday of our lives Truly we are made for Him Or in the words of St Paul Our true citizenship is in heaven Philippians 320 This journey towards our true homeland has already begun We walk it everyday Does our life here and now reflect an intimate communion with the Lord as seen through our love of Him and of our neighbor This focus on our true homeland of heaven is reflected not only in our liturgical calendar but also in the month of November This month as seen by our recent celebrations and commemorations is one dedicated to the Holy Souls We are invited to pray in a special way throughout this month for our deceased loved ones and all those who have gone before us See the included insert for suggestions and indulgences available throughout this month This Tuesday November 5th our nation concludes another election season Though our true homeland is heaven we are still called to participate in our nation's political and public life It is our responsibility to learn more of Catholic teaching and tradition to participate in Church life to learn from trustworthy sources about the issues facing our communities and to do our best to make wise judgments about candidates and government actions As it often seems that election seasons are a time of anxiety and spiritual trials I offer an encouraging practice suggested by our national bishops conference Take time away from social media and spend time with Holy Scripture and the Blessed Sacrament Turn off the TV and the podcast and listen in silence Pray often As a reminder our Church is always open for prayer Never hesitate to come and spend time with the King of Kings Parish Trivia Night Join us on Tuesday November 19t h at 6:30PM for Parish Trivia Night at Parlor City Brewery You are invited to participate in teams of two as we go through a variety of trivia topics Please see the sign up in the Narthex to sign up your teams Food and drink will be available for purchase We are working with the brewery to have a menu available ahead of time for pre ordering Liturgy of the Eucharist Our Father Following Holy Holy Holy we enter into the central point of the Liturgy of the Eucharist The Consecration Given how often we focus on this topic the very pinnacle of the Liturgy of the Eucharist we will move forward in this treatment to focus on other portions of the liturgy As our Lord is made present to us on the altar in the Holy Eucharist we proclaim the Mystery of Faith and conclude the Eucharistic Prayer with the Final Doxology The Final Doxology coming from St Paul's Letter to the Romans Romans 1136 recognizes that all things come from are caused by and exist for God as we lift up the Body and Blood of Christ towards the heavens Fittingly we respond to this praise of the Father with the Great Amen We like the angels respond in gratitude to Jesus and His Sacrifice eager to join our voices to the praise of God with our collective Amen Standing together as one in the Body of Christ we now dare to recognize God as Our Father In this prayer given to us from the mouth of the Savior Himself we are invited to enter into the prayer of the Son to the Father configuring us ever more closely into the image of Christ The very structure of this prayer teaches us the order in which we should pray for what we rightly desire Of seven petitions given three focus first on the Father and then four on man emphasizing the call heard today to love God and neighbor Weekend of November 9th 10th 500 Dan Lautzenheiser 730 David Smith 1000 Jay Crisp 500 Dan Geimer 730 Ben Wagner 1000 Jacque Johnson 500 Laurisa Roper 730 Twilla Herr 1000 Tammi Helm Rick

Pledge card please do so on or before November 10th as all pledges need to be turned into the Diocese by November 15th These Scriptures reveal that when we repent of our sins God removes both our guilt and eternal punishment BUT temporal earthly punishment may remain For this reason the Church can ask us to perform some action here on earth so that we may fulfill that temporal punishment here and now To help us better understand indulgences consider this example You make a mess of your room because you are mad at your mom and she forgives you BUT your room is still messy and you need to clean up your room The Poor Souls in Purgatory are still cleaning up the temporal effects of sin in their souls before they go to Heaven They HAVE been forgiven by God and will go to Heaven but like the messy bedroom they still need to clean up their room first What is a plenary indulgence plenary indulgence is defined in the Catechism of the Catholic Church as a remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven which the faithful Christian who is duly disposed gains under certain prescribed conditions through the action of the Church which as the minister of redemption dispenses and applies with authority the treasury of the satisfactions of Christ and the saints Knights of Columbus Father Aloysius Phillips Council 7555 Saint Joseph was
