Sunday of Advent December 7 2025 Immaculate Conception Holy Day of Obligation The Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception is a holy day of obligation and falls tomorrow Monday December 8th As our nation's patronal feast day we rejoice in how God preserved the Blessed Virgin Mary from all stain of sin so that she might be truly free to embrace her mission as Theotokos Mother of God To aide in our obligation to assist at the Sacrifice of the Mass for this holy day we will offer four Mass times for the Holy Day Vigil Holy Day Mass on Sunday Dec 7th at 5 PM Holy Day Masses on Monday Dec 8th at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM Please Note We have an obligation to assist at Masses for both the Second Sunday of Advent and the Holy Day of the Immaculate Conception The special Sunday Vigil Mass at 5 PM can count for ONE of these obligations NOT both Forty Hours Devotion St Joseph Consecration Join us for the start of our third annual Forty Hours Devotion with our opening Mass celebrating the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception on Monday December 8th at 7 PM Our Eucharistic Speaker Dcn Rob Lortie will offer the homily at our opening Mass He will also lead our eucharistic reflection on Tuesday December 9th at 7 PM and offer our homily at the closing Mass on Wednesday December 10th at 7 PM The closing Mass on Wednesday will conclude our parish's Consecration to St Joseph At the end of Mass we will pray the Act of Consecration together Those who cannot be with us are encouraged to do so privately Advent Penance Service December 17th from 600 7:00PM Our Advent Penance Service will be on Wednesday December 17th from 600 7:00PM in the Church We will be joined by three priests to help with hearing confessions I would encourage you to join us especially if it may have been some time since you've last had a chance to avail yourself of this wondrous Sacrament What better way to prepare our hearts for Christmas Day than to give it over entirely to the Lord in Confession Renovation Starting Date Monday January 5 2026 Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum Habemus principium Paraphrasing the script that announces the election of the Holy Father I announce to you great joy We have a start date Shawnee Construction has set January 5 2026 as the official start date for the general construction of our parish renovation project We are anticipating twenty weeks for total construction with a tentative completion date of Pentecost Sunday May 24 2026 In preparation for renovations our last weekend Masses in the Church will be on the Feast of the Holy Family December 28th After December 28th our weekend Masses will move to the Parish Social Hall We will use the week before construction starts to begin removing the pews from the Church and moving furniture and statuary to the Parish Social Hall as we transform the hall into a fitting sanctuary for our weekend Masses After the flooring has been laid and the repaired pews returned the majority of work in the body of the Church will be completed This means that though construction in the sanctuary will be ongoing during the weekdays we will be able to return to the Church for our weekend Masses before our renovation is completed We are hoping to be back in the Church for weekend Masses before the start of Holy Week March 29 2026 For our weekday Masses we will transform the Parish Conference Room into a daily Mass chapel for the full duration of our renovations This means that throughout the week the Blessed Sacrament will also be reserved in the Parish Conference Room which will remain open at all hours as a place for prayer As our project start date nears we will transition the conference room into a suitable chapel while also trying to maximize available seating Saturday December 6 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary
