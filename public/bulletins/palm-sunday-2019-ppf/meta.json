into this most sacred time of the Church year it is my great joy to be able to celebrate these precious days of Holy Week with you as your priest Walking together as a parish family we will be invited throughout our various liturgies this week to deepen our relationship with the Lord I strongly encourage you and all of our parish families to make every effort to join together in prayer throughout Holy Week The schedule of our major liturgies and additional times for the Sacrament of Confession are listed on the front page of the bulletin I would also encourage you to personally reach out and invite family and friends especially those who might be interested in the Church or have been away from the Church for some time to join with our parish family in prayer during this most sacred time Speaking of our parish family I would like to take a moment and ex press my deepest gratitude to our many parents and grandparents who faithfully ensure that our youngest parishioners are with us at the sacrifice of the Mass each weekend As your priest it is a true blessing in my life to see our parish so alive and to know that our Faith the greatest gift that we can share is being passed on to the youngest among us No matter how young each child in their own way and with their own voice unites themselves with the whole Church in worship of God when they are present at Mass My heart rejoices that we as a parish take seriously our Lords command to let the children come to me and do not prevent them Matthew 1914 With the celebration of Palm Sunday and our commemoration of Jesus messianic entrance into Jerusalem the Church enters into Holy Week We call this week holy not because of anything we do but because of what the Lord has done for us Throughout this week we will focus our prayer on the suffer ing death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ through our various litur gies Please see the doublesided insert in this bulletin for my own reflections on the various liturgies of Holy Week in our diocese and also for a useful in fographic Guide to Holy Week This infographic guide not only explains what each day of Holy Week represents and what we will see in our liturgies but also suggests ideas of how continue these liturgical celebrations in our own daily lives Reminder Good Friday is a day of fasting limiting ourselves to one normal and two small meals throughout the day and abstinence from meat In Christ Fr David Christ does not force our will He takes only what we give him But he does not give himself entirely until he sees that we yield ourselves entirely to him St Teresa of Avila HOLY WEEKEASTER TRIDUUM 2019 HOLY THURSDAY MASS OF THE LORDS SUPPER 7:00pm Cantors LarryNancy Leitz Lector Barb Ault Eucharistic Ministers Diana Cole DaveMargie Huss Jill
