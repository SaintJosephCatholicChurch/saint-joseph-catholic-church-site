SECOND SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME JANUARY 20 2019 YEAR As we enter into the liturgical season of Ordinary Time we spend the next seven weeks in the ordered life of the Church as we await the second coming of Jesus Christ This is neither a time of fasting as in Advent and Lent nor of feasting as in Christmas and Easter Instead it is a time where we allow our Lord into the everyday of lives so that He might transform us just as He transformed water into wine at the wedding feast in Cana As our Lord revealed His glory at Cana in Galilee He reveals His glory to us time and time again through the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass He makes Himself present to us in the most intimate of ways through the Holy Eucharist As St John Vianney pa tron saint of priests once said If we really understood the Mass we would die of joy Over the next seven weeks of Ordinary Time we will dedicate a portion of our homily each weekend to walk through the different parts of the Mass Whether it be our first Mass or our last Mass there is always something for us to learn from the sacri fice of Jesus Christ Our first reading Isaiah 6215 comes from Third Isaiah which offers prophecies re garding that which awaits Israel when she is delivered from her exile in Babylon The prophet appointed by God tirelessly and poetically proclaims the wonders of Zion that will be restored Though Jerusalem has been destroyed hope springs eternal when we are willing to trust in Gods providence most especially when all might otherwise seem lost The prophets use of nuptial imagery in uniting God with Zion emphasizes the cove nantal nature the two share covenant is not simply a contractual agreement but the forming of a familial bond as exemplified in the marriage covenant Though Israel is now in exile they remain Gods chosen people and He their beloved will never aban don them The nuptial imagery of Isaiah pairs beautifully with our Gospel John 2111 of the wedding feast in Cana Jesus and His disciples join in this great time of celebration In Jesus time a wedding feast was not simply a day of celebration but an entire week of great rejoicing and merriment at the new covenant entered into by the bride and groom In the same way as Christians we are called to rejoice in the new covenant we have entered into through Jesus Christ and His sacrifice of the cross Jesus is urged by His mother to assist the couple when the wine has run short Jesus reference to His mother as Woman which He would refer to her again as when He hung upon the cross should draw our minds to Genesis and the first woman Eve Mary in her Fiat or Yes to Gods will serves as the new Eve Genesis 35 of the New Covenant Her command to the servants Do whatever He tells you shows a complete trust in her Son and serves as the perfect advice to be given to every Chris tian This advice highlights our second reading 1 Corinthians 12411 as St Paul is writing to the Christian community in Corinth He has seen the church that he has founded in Corinth to be in disarray and forming factions In this epistle he attempts to restore unity and highlights our diversity as the many parts of Christs one body Speaking di rectly of spiritual gifts in this passage he reminds the Corinthians that the gifts of the Spirit are many and require proper discernment We must always be striving to fulfill the will of God and not our own wills in our words and actions As our Blessed Mother has said in our Gospel today Do whatever the Lord tells us This requires in part a death to self as we crucify our own desires to live fully for the Lord Though not an easy task it often takes a lifetime to fully put into practice it is one that allows to live entirely for the Lord In recognizing that we are truly many parts we can begin to see the beauty of that diversity and yet find our unity together in the Body of Christ Though we may serve in different ways to build up Gods kingdom we are still building up the same kingdom These differences in vocations and ministries show the true beauty of the Christian faith as we see the many gifts and talents the many parts come together to form the one Body of Christ May we strive for this unity as St Paul calls us to and may we find the path to that unity by taking to heart the words our Blessed Mother has given us Do whatever He tells you Fr David WEEKEND OF January 2627 2019
