<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Mass times for Christmas will be:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Christmas Eve - 4:00 PM, 6:00 PM, and Midnight</strong></li>
<li><strong>Christmas Day - 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following diocesan recommendations, we&rsquo;ve increased the number of Masses offered for Christmas this year to ensure that we can practice proper social distancing within the church. Overflow seating will be available in the Parish Social Hall for all Masses if needed. We will plan on live-streaming all five of our liturgies for those unable to join us in-person on Christmas Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><strong>Note</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The Midnight Mass will be offered by candlelight and Christmas lights; This means that the main church lights will be dimmed throughout the Midnight Mass. Incense will also be used at the Midnight Mass.)</span></p>
