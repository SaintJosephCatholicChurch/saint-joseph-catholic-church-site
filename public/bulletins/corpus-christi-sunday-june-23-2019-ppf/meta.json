Gal 511318 Lk 95162 THE MOST HOLY BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST CORPUS CHRISTI SUNDAY June 23 2019 Today the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Je sus Christ or Corpus Christi Having celebrated the divine communion of the three persons of the Most Holy Trinity this past Sunday we celebrate today our invitation into this divine communion through our reception of the Holy Eucharist This invita tion was prefigured in the Old Testament Genesis 141820 and realized in the New Testament 1 Corinthians 112326 Every time that we approach the altar we're ceive Jesus Christ Himself in Holy Communion passed through the hands of His priest Luke 91117 We receive Him not in symbol or as a representation but as a reality Body Blood Soul and Divinity Receiving Jesus in the Holy Eucharist we are called to become more like Him whom we have received In approaching the Eucharist we cannot leave un changed As Jesus freely gives Himself to us we are called to give our lives for one another As we prepare ourselves to approach our Lord may we prepare our hearts for change May we seek forgiveness through the Sacrament of Confession for those times we have turned away from the Lord through sin 1 Corinthians 112829 May we find ourselves contemplating ever anew on the living Word of God in the Holy Scriptures And as we approach the altar of the Lords sacrifice may we reflect on how reception of the Holy Eucharist today will change our lives Updates from Washington DC My first summer at the Catholic University of America CUA has been go ing well Upon arriving I moved into Theological College which overlooks the Ba silica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and is adjacent to the CUA Campus Throughout this and next month I am taking the equivalent of two semesters of schoolwork This past Monday we had our midterms and this coming Friday we will have our finals for the June semester After next weekend we will begin our July semester The courses Ive been in this past month have been very educational In these introductory courses on Canon Law I am seeing the Church through its administra tive structure Yet as dry as that might seem it is still an aspect of the Churchs life And every one of the 1752 canons that speak of the various administrative acts of the Church are still focused on one thing Suprema ratio est salus animarum The su preme law of the Church is the salvation of souls This was a saying taught to us many years ago in the seminary and has been reinforced even as I begin studies this summer Every aspect of the life of the Church is meant to point us to heaven Most of my days have been spent either in class or reading in preparation for classes though I have had a few free moments to tour some of our national sites Over the coming weeks I will try and include a few photos from our Catholic heritage here in Washington DC on our bulletin cover There are truly many amazing sites churches and shrines to visit that reflect the rich history of our faith here in the na tions capital May each of you being have a blessed summer and know of my contin ued prayers for all of you I look forward to seeing you again in August Faithfully in Christ Fr David As an additional note Ive received several requests asking for my mailing address this summer If youd like to drop a line my mailing address for the

catechists is one of the most difficult challenges that a parish faces We often think of these three things when asked 1 I do not know my faith well enough to share it 2 That is something for other people to do 3 It takes too much time Fear not Becoming a catechist teacher is a matter of being able to share your Catholic faith Classes are only one hour and fifteen minutes 830945 am on Sundays between Masses It is very rewarding to watch the children of our parish grow in their faith while supporting the families here at St Josephs If you are considering the call to serve as a catechist
