  "text": "Third Sunday in Ordinary Time January 22 2023 This weekend January 21st 22nd the Church celebrates the Third Sunday in Ordinary Time or Word of God Sunday This second title given to this weekend by Pope Francis in 2019 emphasizes our need to have an intimate familiarity with the Sacred Scriptures Though this is now celebrated yearly in the words of our Holy Father it should not be seen as a yearly event but rather a year long event Our relationship with the Sacred Scriptures cannot be regulated to a single day but is to be a lifetime journey On Monday January 23rd our national Bishops Conference has asked all Christians and people of good will to join together in a day of prayer and fasting for the legal protection of unborn children This yearly day of prayer and fasting often falls either on the day of or when it falls on a Sunday a day immediately following the yearly anniversary of the Roe v Wade Supreme Court Decision This year is no exception This serves as a reminder that though we have seen this decision overturned by the Dobbs v Jackson Decision this past year our efforts to build a culture of life have not ended The need for witnesses of love continues in the face of a culture that finds life disposable We cannot forget that basic human dignity arises from our being loved first by God May we cultivate a respect for this dignity in every person and show it forth in how we treat every other person The Roman Canon The First Popes Continuing our look at the Saints in the Roman Canon we move from the Apostles to the early successors of St Peter Sts Linus Cletus Clement Sixtus and Cornelius Of these Saints the first three Sts Linus Cletus and Clement are the immediate successors to St Peter Sts Sixtus and Cornelius are later Popes both having served as Vicar of Christ in the 3rd Century Though their order is reversed in the Roman Canon St Cornelius reigned as Pope several years prior to St Sixtus This ordering however is most likely due to Sts Linus Cletus Clement and Sixtus all having directly suffered martyrdom or being put to death for the Faith While St Cornelius is also considered a martyr he was not directly put to death but instead died from the hardships he suffered while being exiled by the Roman Emperor Gallus Church Bell Restoration and Naming This past Monday our old Church bell traveled to Cincinnati Ohio where it was delivered to the Verdin Company The Verdin Company cast the bell 121 years ago and are working with us for its repair and restoration This process is estimated to take six months In addition to the work on the bell itself we will also need to prepare a base for the bell once it is returned We are looking into various options to arrange for the needed concrete and electrical work to complete the base of the bell for placement on our parish campus In addition to this work we will also be holding a naming contest for the bell Over the past millennia the Church has had the custom of naming a bell after a Saint when it is blessed This practice can be traced back to at least AD 969 when Pope John XIII dedicated a bell in honor of St John the Baptist From a review of our records it appears that our old bell was never formally named when it was installed in 1902 As we will have a new dedication and blessing of the bell upon its installation on our campus we will also use this opportunity to name the bell Starting next weekend you will find contest envelopes in the narthex and pews to suggest a name for the bell The only guideline for this contest is that the suggestions must be the name of a Saint We are suggesting a 5 free will donation included in the envelope with every name suggestion Please return any contest envelopes in the collection basket or to the Parish Office All donations raised from this naming contest will be used to offset any unexpected costs that may arise during the restoration process Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday January 21
