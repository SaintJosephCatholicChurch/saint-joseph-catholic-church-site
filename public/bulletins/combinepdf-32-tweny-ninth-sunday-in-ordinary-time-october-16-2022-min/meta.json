  "text": "Twenty Ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time October 16 2022 special Thank You to Fr Dave Ruppert pastor of St Mary's in Decatur for celebrating our liturgies while I am away for vacation this weekend This weekend October 15th 16th the Church celebrates the Twenty ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings combine the imagery of war and prayer in interesting ways meant to provoke our thoughts about the nature and reality of supplicating God In this we see that through faith in the power of prayer we experience God's love and assistance In addition our Christian life is itself nourished by the Sacred Scriptures that we read and by the traditions that we have received Campus Improvements Parish Gym Repairs We have had long term issues involving drainage and water leakage in our Parish Gym for a number of years The first step to address this issue involved moving the Parish Playground to help the natural flow of rainwater away from the Gym walls This step was completed with the dedication of our new Parish Playground just a few weeks ago The second step has involved addressing cracks in the gym foundation that were allowing water to leak into the gym This issue has been worked on over the past several weeks through extensive excavation and repair work along the foundation special Thank You to parishioner Doug Dunwiddie for his dedicated work in bringing these repairs to completion The third step involves drainage issues around the exterior gym doors and will be looked at in the coming future Liturgical Directives General Updates Having spent most of this week with the priests of our diocese for our annual Continuing Education Days I had the opportunity to speak with many of our experienced pastors regarding any remaining COVID protocols that their parishes still have in place What I learned is that the vast majority of the parishes in our diocese have safely returned to full seating capacity within their churches proper and seen no discernable effects from doing so After learning of this previously consulting our Parish Council and having spoken with our diocesan Office of Worship I feel that we can confidently move towards removing the ropes from our remaining distanced pews We will plan to remove the remaining ropes at the end of this month Oct 31st As a reminder our Ushers Room is open for seating at our weekend Masses for those who due to health reasons cannot be seated in a pew Regarding distribution of the Most Precious Blood through the chalice this practice remains paused throughout our diocese After much discussion at our last Presbyteral Council meeting Bishop Rhoades decided to consult with the bishops of the four other dioceses in our state before making a decision to resume distribution Having spoken with a number of priest friends throughout the country it also does not sound that there has been any uniform decision on this practice in the various dioceses in the States as of this moment For the distribution of the Body of Christ through the Host we will be continuing our current practice of the celebrant distributing from the center aisle for the foreseeable future After following our protocol over the past two years this has become a personal decision on my part As your pastor I have found it to be a true spiritual blessing to be able to distribute our Lord or to offer a blessing to each and every person coming forward for Communion Though we simply serve as His instrument in this moment it is truly a joyous moment I have come to cherish each weekend Having the great blessing to see each one of your faces as you approach the Lord in the Eucharist In our quiet prayer after Communion I use those fleeting moments to offer a prayer for each of you Given our intimate parish size this practice does not lengthen our liturgy in any considerable way Once we are able to resume distributing the Most Precious Blood I will be asking the assistance of our Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion for distribution of the chalices MASS INTENTIONS Saturday October 15 No 8:00am Morning Mass 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Evelyn Morrissey Sunday October 16 Twenty Ninth
