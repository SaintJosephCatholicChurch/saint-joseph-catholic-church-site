1261 6 Heb 51 6 Mk 1046 52 Twenty Ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time October 20 2024 This past week I spent Tuesday Thursday attending a series of conferences with the priests of our diocese This series part of our annual continuing education focused on praying and preaching with the Sacred Scriptures We heard from five speakers professors from the Theology Department at Notre Dame who offered great insight into the various elements of the Scriptures One of the main takeaways I received from the conferences is this beautiful reminder All Scripture is meant for us The Sacred Scriptures are the living and active word of God that speaks to us here and now Read in the light of Sacred Tradition and through the guidance of the Magisterium we prayerfully experience and are called to share that abundant wealth that is the divine word Ask Father Election Edition Join us this Tuesday October 22nd for a special Ask Father Election Edition as we look at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops annual handout on political responsibility Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship This document is meant to help Catholics in better forming their consciences to be able to contribute to civil and respectful public dialogue and shape political choices in the coming election in light of Catholic teaching Theology on Tap Angels and Demons Our next Theology on Tap will be at Parlor City Brewery 212 Market St Bluffton on Tuesday Oct 29th starting at 6:30PM This event is open to all 21 as we turn our attention towards the spiritual side of creation and speak on a truth of the Faith Angels and Demons Food and drink will be available for purchase at the Brewery Update on Parish Renovations Part I I am very excited to announce some forward movement regarding parish renovations To date we have received approval from both Bishop Rhoades and the Liturgy Committee of our diocesan Office of Worship to enter the planning phase for renovations Since then I've had the opportunity along with members of our Parish Staff and Finance Committee to meet with Bill Heyer of William Heyer Architecture out of Bexley Ohio Bill and his firm come highly recommended from parishes throughout our diocese In just the past few years his firm built St Francis Oratory at the University of St Francis and St Mary Magdalene Oratory at St Vincent de Paul in Fort Wayne renovated the church chapel and narthex at St Charles in Fort Wayne is currently renovating the adoration chapel at St Jude in Fort Wayne and planning renovations at St Rose of Lima in Monroeville During our meeting we had the opportunity to walk through our Church and discuss a number of possibilities to both upkeep and build upon its beauty Most needed as many have noticed is updated flooring to replace our heavily worn carpet fresh paint in the sanctuary and nave due to wear and damage and an increased seating capacity to accommodate our growing parish family With these needs in mind I've asked Bill to put together an initial design so that we as a parish family can better conceptualize some of the possibilities available to us This will be our first major renovation as a parish in nearly 25 years with the addition of the EJ Schaefer Parish Center in 2000 I look forward to see what God will bring about for our parish at this time Liturgy of the Eucharist The Preface Once the altar is prepared and the Offertory comes a close the Preface marks the start of the Eucharistic Prayer in the Liturgy of the Eucharist This prayerful transition is meant to excite the Faithful to devotion for what is about to happen at the altar The Sacrifice of Jesus Christ offered to the Father First a dialogue takes place between the priest and the Faithful The words spoken from both priest and Faithful are immersed in biblical significance Then the dialogue changes with the Preface prayer The priest now speaks on behalf of the Faithful as the head of the Body of Christ gathered together This prayer is one of gratitude between Son and Father for the sacrifice of salvation Weekend of October 26th and 27th 500 David Smith 730 Josie Andrews 1000 Jay Crisp 500 Dan Geimer 730 Carol Butler 1000 Patti Clark
