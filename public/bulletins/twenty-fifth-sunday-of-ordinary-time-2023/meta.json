  "text": "Twenty Fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time September 24 2023 This weekend September 23rd 24th the Church celebrates the Twenty fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time We continue to hear from the fourth great discourse of St Matthew's Gospel hearing today what is known as both the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard or The Parable of the Good Employer This parable is itself unique in that it is only found in St Matthew's Gospel and not the other synoptic gospels St Luke and St Mark As October quickly nears we have a number of events upcoming Next Sunday October 1st will be our Parish Picnic following the 10 AM Mass The following Saturday October 7th we will host our annual Blessing of Animals in honor of St Francis of Assisi's Feast Day On October 15th we will be holding a memorial service for all those who have suffered miscarriages and lost children In November we are planning for our quick approach Forty Hours Watch the bulletin for further updates for these many events Forty Days for Life On Monday September 25th our Knights of Columbus will meet at 5:30PM in the parish parking lot to prepare our annual cross display for the Forty Days for Life Sept 26th to Nov 5th All are welcome to come on Monday and help the Knights in setting up this display There will be 319 crosses placed on our grounds representing the 319 children aborted from Wells County since 1998 when records were first kept by the Department of Health Sadly several additional crosses have been added for this past year Though last year welcomed major changes with the Supreme Court decision of Dobbs v Jackson this annual display serves as a reminder that the work to build a true culture of life continues This culture as described by Pope St John Paul must recognize every person's dignity respect their basic human rights and defend and promote life at every stage Evangelium Vitae Paragraph 101 It is for these very reasons that we as a parish support and partner with many local organizations that both promote life and support those in need here and now Annual Bishop's Appeal As mentioned last weekend every registered parish family should have or will shortly be receiving their pledge card from the Annual Bishop's Appeal in the mail This annual drive helps to support the various charitable outreaches and ministries of our diocese as exemplified in the Bishop's letter In addition to this letter the diocese also releases a yearly video that offers a more detailed account of how the appeal funds are utilized each year For those interested this video can now be viewed on our parish website Our parish goal for this year's appeal is 3724371 Any amount that goes over this goal will be returned directly to our parish This year's overage will be put towards our coming Church renovations As a parish we are seeking 100 participation from every registered parish family As such please make sure to fill out and return your pledge card either by mail or in the weekly collection basket We will also have blank pledge cards available after all Masses the second weekend in October to help us reach this 100 participation goal Synod on Synodality This Wednesday Bishop Rhoades will begin his journey to Rome as a participating member of the upcoming Synod on Synodality Our bishop was selected by his brother bishops to be one of the five bishops representing our country at the Synod As a parish we participated in the parish phase of this synod back in February of 2022 through a local listening session The result of this session and similar ones from parishes throughout the diocese were collected into a working document that was shared with our national bishops conference Our national conference as well as all national conferences throughout the world compiled their various results into a single working document that will help to guide the Synod this coming month May we keep Bishop Rhoades and the other participants of this synod in our prayers Saturday September
