<p>Join us in praying a Novena to conclude the 40 Days for Life Prayer Campaign.</p>
<p>We will begin this prayer on Friday, Oct. 25th, at 7 PM in the Church. Booklets will be available to take home and continue the Novena on your own. There will also be a public chance to gather in prayer each evening at 7 PM (or, if there is a 7 PM Mass that evening, following that Mass). [Note: There are 7 PM Masses on Wednesday, Oct. 29th, and Friday, Oct. 31st.]</p>
<p>We will conclude our Novena on Saturday, Nov. 2nd, prior to the 5 PM Vigil Mass.</p>
