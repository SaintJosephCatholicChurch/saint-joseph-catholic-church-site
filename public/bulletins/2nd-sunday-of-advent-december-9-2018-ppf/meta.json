December 9 2018 Year The very start of our Gospel today Luke 316 reminds us that Jesus nativity is not only a salvific event but also a historical one In listing the civil and religious leaders of the day St Luke as he often does solidly inserts the reader of his gospel into the Palestinian and Roman history in which Jesus life and ministry takes place In under standing this history we can begin to glimpse the excitement present in Israel at the time of Jesus nativity Holding the Old Testament prophecies cf Daniel 9 in their hearts the people of Israel know that the time of the Messiah whom they have awaited for centuries is near if not already before them For this reason the cry of John the Baptist begins to build excitement throughout all of Israel The longawaited Messiah is near The excitement of Israel for the coming of the Messiah is beautifully depicted for us in our first reading from the prophet Baruch Bar 519 Baruch is an assistant to the prophet Jeremiah and as with Jeremiah lived during the time of the Babylonian exile His prophecies then speak to an Israel who had been taken captive exiled from their homeland and lived in desolation Though all seemed lost Baruch reminds Israel that all hope is not lost if they place their trust in the Lord He calls Israel to repent of their idolatrous ways and return to the Lord The Lord through the Messiah will joyfully return Israel to their true homeland and once again make of them a great nation Though this may have seemed impossible Baruch reminds Israel that by trusting in the Lord all things become possible The joy of Israel that Baruch prophesies is captured today by the Psalmist Psalm 127 The Lord has done great things for us We are filled with joy This same feeling of joy is arising in Israel just surely as the star arose above Bethlehem on Christmas Eve The time is truly at hand John the Baptist crying out from the desert only increases Israels anticipation This anticipation finds its fulfillment only in Jesus Christ And as this anticipation is with Israel in our Gospel today so it must be with us everyday es pecially this Advent season Just as Jesus Christ the Son of God took on flesh and entered the world on Christmas Day now we must prepare for Him to enter our hearts through the Holy Eucharist His true presence and to come again in glory at the end of time As Israel responded to the call of repentance from John the Baptist we to must respond to the call of repentance from our Lord Repent and believe in the Gospel Mark 115 Our readings today remind us that Advent is truly a penitential time Though we may face the temptation to move right ahead to the joy and celebration of Christmas we mustnt lose sight of what we are celebrating This Second Sunday of Advent reminds us that we celebrate something greater than a holiday We celebrate a holy day as we welcome salvation Himself Jesus Christ into the world And just as He came into the world so He wishes to come into our lives Just as Jesus first entered the world in a time of great unrest so He wishes to enter into our lives right now He does not wish to wait until everything is perfect because that time will never come this side of heaven Jesus wishes to be with us right now in our trials struggles and mess He enters into our lives to bring His peace calm and joy In Advent we spend this time preparing our hearts to welcome and enthrone Him both as the Christchild on Christmas Day and the Saviour who will come again in glory and majesty May we welcome Jesus now into the messiness of our lives We do this not by trying to have the perfect holiday but by seeing Jesus in every moment of the day When everything is going right and most especially when everything is going wrong Even in the midst their desolation Israel finds hope in God We as followers of Jesus Christ are called to do the same Through daily personal prayer prayer as a family reading of the Sacred Scriptures and spiritual reading reception of the Sacraments especially Confession attendance at Holy Mass works of charity In these ways we can encounter Jesus Christ this Advent And every time that we encounter Jesus Christ our life is changed Entering this second week of Advent what are we doing to prepare not simply for Christmas but for Christ How are we welcoming Him into our lives even our messiness right now Christ is coming May we always be prepared to re ceive Him anew Fr David WEEKEND OF December 1516 2018 CANTORS 500 Sophie Emrah 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Nancy Leitz Choir Mass LECTORS 500 Ginny

MitchelJustinPhillip Mayer 1000 Kody Coyne EveGabe McElhaney STEWARDSHIP CORNER I could not figure out why it was that it seemed to be that Catholics worshiped Mary even though I knew worship of Mary was clearly condemned by the Church Then I got an insight Protestants defined worship as songs prayers and a sermon So when Catholics sang songs to Mary petitioned Mary in prayer and preached about her Protestants concluded she was being worshiped But Catholics defined worship as the sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Jesus and Catholics would never have offered a sacrifice of Mary nor to Mary on the altar This was helpful food for thought Kimberly Hahn Rome Sweet Home Collection for Weekend of December 12 2018 Adult Envelopes 305700 Child Envelopes2536 Loose 25700 Religious Ed Fund 5000
