2446 53 Sixth Sunday of Easter May 25 2025 This weekend May 24th 25th the Church celebrates the Sixth Sunday of Easter As our Easter celebration continues it can almost seem as if its too much Fifty days of joy in the midst of a fallen world Yet that is exactly the point The Resurrection of Jesus Christ isn't just an event of the past It's a living reality present to our lives here and now Easter reminds us that even amidst suffering loss and uncertainty the final word belongs to life to Christ This reality is seen even today as our nation commemorates Memorial Day this Monday May 26th This commemoration remembers and honors our servicemen and women who have served our country and given their lives in defense of our freedom Viewed through our Easter celebration we faithfully entrust these men and women into the hands of the Risen Christ who has gone before us in death and opened the way to eternal life As part of our Memorial Day commemoration join us for a special Mass on Memorial Day Monday May 26th at 9:00AM offered for all those who have given their lives in service to our nation Newly Ordained Deacons Congratulations to the new transitional deacons of our Diocese Deacons Jonathan Hickey Noah Isch Samuel Martinez and Greenan Sullivan ordained by Bishop Rhoades at the Cathedral this past Saturday Their classmate Mr Patrick Ernst will be ordained a deacon in Rome this fall Continue to keep them in your prayers as these five men will God willing be ordained as priests of our Diocese next year Summer Traveling and Sunday Mass As the summer months are beginning many of us are setting travel plans for vacations celebrations and family gatherings throughout June July and August When planning don't forget to also plan for our Sunday Mass obligation by finding local parishes to attend wherever your travels take you great resource to help you locate Mass times across the country and even internationally is <a href=\"www.MassTimes.org\">www.MassTimes.org</a> One of the most beautiful aspects of our Catholic faith is its universality No matter where we are in the world we can find a parish and join in the one Eucharistic sacrifice of the Mass Attending local parishes while traveling reminds us that we are part of something much larger a Church united in Christ throughout every corner of the globe No matter where we go we are truly never far from home in the heart of Christ's Church Acts 15 The Council of Jerusalem Our first reading this weekend comes from the Acts of the Apostles Chapter 15 This scriptural account illustrates how the early Church resolved theological conflict through authoritative leadership The issue at hand was whether Gentiles must first follow the Mosaic Law to enter the New Covenant Scripture alone which at that time was only the Old Testament offered no clear answer Therefore a council was called what could be considered the first ecumenical council as they sought the guidance of the Apostles After much debate St Peter arises and spoke decisively to the group Those assembled listened in silence as the debated ended with Peter's words St James leader of the local Church in Jerusalem confirms Peter's judgment As Peter authoritatively settled the debate and provided the answer to the issue at hand so James provides practical ways to live out Peter's guidance The Church maintains unity as the decision is accepted by all present and beyond This chapter shows that Church authority the Magisterium is essential for preserving unity and peace in the Church Peter's decision was accepted even by those whose views were rejected True holiness accepts the Churchs judgment in faith The Apostles gathered around Peter serve as the model for Church governance Without this structure the Church would fracture as has happened again and again to those outside of Her authority In Christ Fr David Weekend of May 31st June 1st 5:00pm Sam Smith 7:30am Donna Geisel 10:00am Adult Choir 5:00pm Stacey
