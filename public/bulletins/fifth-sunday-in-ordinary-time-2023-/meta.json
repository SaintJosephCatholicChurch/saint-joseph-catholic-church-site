Ps 321 2 5 11 1 Cor 1031 111 Mk 140 45 Fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time February 4 2024 This weekend February 3rd 4th the Church celebrates the Fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time This means that we are now only a week and a half away from Ash Wednesday and the start of the Lenten season During Lent we pray the Stations of the Cross every Friday at 7 PM All are welcome This past Friday we celebrated the Presentation of the Lord to mark forty days since Christmas Day This was the day that our Lord fulfilling the Law of Moses Leviticus 121 8 this was presented in the Temple by the Blessed Virgin Mary and St Joseph We heard how Simeon prophesied that Jesus is a light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory for your people Israel Luke 232 It was a final moment of Christmas joy in our liturgical year With this celebration the last of our Christmas decorations eg the Nativity scene have been put away We truly have returned to Ordinary Time and a season of simplicity Quite appropriately our gloomy weather has seemingly matched our current place in the liturgical year Just as the sun has been hidden by the overcast sky so the last fleeting joys of our Christmas season have gone away and we will soon be overcast by the scandal of the Cross Though it seems overcast now we know that the divine Sun of Justice that rose brightly in Bethlehem has not left us Just as the sun is still there behind the clouds the Word became flesh so that He might dwell among us and He remains with us even now As we approach the Lenten season we know that even darker clouds await as the Lord approaches His Passion Yet even those terrible clouds will soon be dispersed by the light of His Resurrection Ash Wednesday and Roofing Nails priest that I served with would give out roofing nails on Ash Wednesday and invite them to be carried in one's pocket for the forty days of Lent As roofing nails are blunt there was no danger in carrying one in your pocket Instead it was just awkward enough of a shape to be annoying At the end of the forty days you would be quite happy to get rid of it The lesson was simple The nail represented sin and we want to get rid of sin from our lives Sin can be both mortal deadly and venial harmful Both are to be avoided yet often our focus is only on mortal sin or those sins that break our relationship with God Yet in the Christian life we are called to root out all sin from our lives both those that destroy our relationship and those that harm it Lent is a time to focus on the rooting out of all sin from our lives During Lent we enter into the desert with the Lord As the Lord found strength and virtue in facing temptation in the desert so the disciplines of Lent aid us in strengthening our will to say no to sin For this reason we often adapt the practice of making some form of sacrifice during Lent In giving up something during Lent we turn away from ourselves and recognize that God alone will ultimately satisfy our needs and wants and cravings At the very end of our lives we will leave our gifts of time treasure and our bodies in the grave until the Resurrection The Lenten season affords us the opportunity and challenge to live now as children of our heavenly Father reliant on His grace and providence and eager to find our hopes fulfilled in God alone As we quickly approach Lent let us prayerfully discern what sacrifice we are called to make for these forty days and what that sacrifice is meant to reveal or free us from in our lives Returning Palms for Ash Wednesday As a reminder next Sunday Feb 11th is the last day to turn in old palms before Ash Wednesday These palms that were lifted high on Palm Sunday will be burned and the ashes they make will be used to mark our foreheads on Ash Wednesday Just as the lifting of the palms represented Jesus triumphant entry into Jerusalem so the ashes mark our entry into the desert with the Lord for the Lenten season Both of these journeys lead to the Cross The good news however is that neither of these journeys end there In Christ Fr David PARISH CALENDAR Sat Feb 3 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sat Feb 3 Sun Feb 4 Blessing of Throats after all Masses Sun Feb 4 Mass 7:30am
