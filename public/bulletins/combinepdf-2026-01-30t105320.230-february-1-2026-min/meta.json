Sunday in Ordinary Time February 1 2026 This weekend January 31st February 1st the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time Traditionally this Sunday was known as Septuagesima Sunday the beginning of a brief pre Lenten period called Gesimatide Spanning three Sundays and marking roughly seventy days before Easter this season served as a time of preparation for Lent and concluded on Shrove Tuesday more commonly known as Mardi Gras This pre Lenten period was signaled by three liturgical practices that now begin at the start of Lent itself the omission of the Alleluia and the Gloria and the use of violet vestments While the Alleluia would not be heard again until the joy of Easter Sunday solemnities and certain feast days during Gesimatide would briefly return the Gloria and make use of different vestment colors things that Lent itself does not typically permit Despite these penitential feelings the full weight of the Lenten liturgy and life was not yet in force Liturgically the readings remained focused on the post Epiphany preaching of Christian discipleship and the daily prayers did not yet make use of the strong penitential language we associate with Lent Lenten fasting and abstinence had not yet begun This period offered a gentle reminder Conversion starts with a changed heart before a changed routine Diocesan Synod Parish Listening Session Thank you to all those who were able to join us this past Monday for the Opening Mass in preparation for our Parish Listening Session In just over a week on Monday February 9th at 6 PM we will have the opportunity to gather in the Parish Gym for our Parish Listening Session This session will serve as our parish's participation in the preparation for the upcoming Diocesan Synod called by Bishop Rhoades in November of 2026 This session is an opportunity for the Faithful of our diocese to prayerfully reflect together on one central question How is our local Church called to live the mission of Christ today and in the years to come Our Parish Listening Session will allow each of us to share our voices prayerful reflections and experiences as a unique and irreplaceable part of our local Church Our parish session will in turn help guide the direction of the larger Diocesan Synod At the end of the Parish Listening Session the various insights shared will be compiled and submitted to Bishop Rhoades as a faithful representation of our parish's voice With our contributions and those of the other parishes of our diocese Bishop will set the broader synodal questions for reflection at the Diocesan Synod in November College students who are away from the parish for school are also invited to prayerfully participate in a special college synodal session and share their perspective on faith and life on campus Participants are asked to watch a short video message from Bishop Rhoades pray and reflect on five themes and submit their reflections online by Feb 28th To learn more and participate in the special college session visit diocesefwsborgcollege synod Note Childcare will be provided for the Parish Listening Session on February 9th Parish Renovations Precautionary Planning Renovation work in the Church is moving along nicely As of Friday a large portion of the terrazzo in the Church has been poured and is curing As is notable in the conceptual drawings on display in the Schaefer Parish Center the floor work will flow from the Church into the narthex This will help to visualize the connection between the narthex and our baptismal font with that of the nave as we enter into the Church both physically and spiritually Though we are working with Dancer Flooring to minimize inconvenience there is the possibility that we may need to keep the narthex closed for an upcoming weekend If this becomes necessary we will announce it ahead of time and have volunteers available to redirect traffic towards the Parish Office Saturday January 31 400 4:45pm Confession
