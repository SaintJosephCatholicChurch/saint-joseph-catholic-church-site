2025 This weekend May 31st June 1st the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord Traditionally observed on the fortieth day of Eastertide the Ascension actually fell this past Thursday However in our diocese as in most of the United States the celebration is transferred to the nearest Sunday This pastoral adjustment is meant to allow more of the faithful to come together in prayer as we reflect on this mystery of salvation history As described in our Collect for this morning's Mass the Ascension reminds us that where the head has gone before in glory the Body is called to follow in hope Or as St Paul would say our citizenship is in heaven Ephesians 320 Yet the Ascension of the Lord is followed by the descent of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost as we celebrate next Sunday This means that though heaven is our true homeland right now our mission field is right here on earth Pentecost Collection for the Education of Seminarians Next weekend you are invited to support the education and formation of our diocesan seminarians through the annual Pentecost Collection for the Education of Seminarians On behalf of our diocesan seminarians Thank You for your
