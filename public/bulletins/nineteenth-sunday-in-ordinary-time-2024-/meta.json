651 58 Nineteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time August 11 2024 This weekend August 10th 11th the Church celebrates the Nineteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time We remain in the midst of our walk through of the Bread of Life Discourse from the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St John In this chapter our Lord continues to foreshadow His gift of the Holy Eucharist This gift shall be instituted at the Last Supper and is the same gift in which we continue to participate in through the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass Every time that we assist at Mass we are united to Jesus saving Passion Death and Resurrection In reception of Holy Communion we are invited into His transformative sharing of divine life We are to become that which we eat We are what we eat With this greatest of gifts given to us in the Holy Eucharist we must now ask ourselves a two simple questions If we are what we eat what are we eating and what have we become Solemnity of the Assumption Holy Day of Obligation On Thursday the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary This day marks our belief that the Blessed Virgin Mary at the end of her earthly life was assumed body and soul into heaven As this solemnity is a Holy Day of Obligation we are offering several Mass times to assist in meeting this obligation Mass Times for the Solemnity of the Assumption Holy Day of Obligation Vigil Mass on Wednesday August 14th at 7 PM Mass on Thursday August 15th at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM Though the dogma of the Assumption was only formally declared by Pope Pius XII in 1950 the teaching itself can be traced back to the first centuries of the Church By the beginning of the fourth century a church was built to mark the already celebrated ancient and empty Tomb of Mary near Mount Zion This feast day itself was almost universally celebrated in the Eastern Church by 336 AD and by the Western or Roman Church by the sixth century In the middle of the fifth century the Patriarch of Jerusalem St Juvenal was asked by the Emperor Marcian to bring a relic of the Blessed Virgin Mary to the Council of Chalcedon The Patriarch responded that he could not as there were no relics of the Blessed Virgin He explained to the Emperor that Mary had died in the presence of the Apostles Her closed tomb when opened at the request of St Thomas the Apostle however was found empty From this the Apostles knew that Mary's body had been assumed into heaven Parish Council Following the summer break our Parish Council resumed meeting this past week We welcome two new Parish Council members this year Tom
