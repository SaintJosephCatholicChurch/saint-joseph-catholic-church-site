Yonker Sr Priscilla Rogers Eve lyn Morrissey Betty Meyer Ron Payne David Carr Ronnie Bonnie Burns Mi chael Green and Dorothy Dottie Marbach 17Th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME JULY 30 2017 YR From the Pastors Desk WE ARE INVITED TO PURSUE AND POSSES WISDOM OF GOD My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all It is absolutely true that a person of true wisdom like Solomon will seek the reign of God and treasure it above all else For it is more precious than silver and gold All through human history wisdom insight sound judgement is precious possession However human wisdom is not always adequately the same as truth Philosophers sages have narrowed their observation by working with their intellect alone This re sulted in all forms of rationalism that had no eye for the transcendent It is in the Bible that we see and find real wisdom that originated from the heart and intellect It is often an intuitive wisdom of the whole person Biblical wisdom is a special gift of God That is why we must pay attention to it In todays Liturgy wisdom is considered the supreme value of human life The parables of the treasure and the pearls bring out that the Kingdom of God is a value for which no sacrifice is too great Wise and mature Christians have a sound judgment about what is more or less important in life It is so because the Christian blend human insight with the inspired wisdom of God In the 1st Reading 1 Kgs 35 712 Listen to what Solomon requested when God told him to ask whatever he wants Lord my God you have made me your servant king to succeed my father David but I am a mere youth not knowing at all how to act Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people and distinguish right from wrong Look at that Wisdom In response God was so pleased with Solomon and He said Because you have asked for thisnot for long life for yourself nor for riches nor for the life of your enemies but for under standing I give you a heart so wise and understanding that there has never been anyone like you up to now and after you there will come no one to equal you SUPPER WISDOM Selfless request Total dependence on God BE WISE BE HUMBLE GOD IS IN CHARGE In the 2nd Reading Rom 82830St Paul assured us that For those who love God everything works onto good So when we are depressed we should be guided by the God given wisdom for God knows all we need before we ask Him He loves us cares for us we are is creatures If we have faith in Him He will take care of us and our needs In the Gospel Mt 134452 or 4446 Jesus compared the Kingdom of God to a treasure buried in a field which a person finds and hides again and out of joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that field You see proper discernment If God asks you today to make a request what will you ask for Think of it in your heart We need wisdom to be able to know what we need Jesus also compared the Kingdom of heaven with fine pearls of excellent value and the <a href=\"drag.net\">drag.net</a> full of all sort of things You need wisdom to discover the hidden treasure Think of Jed Clampett Beverly Hillbillies Now in US we need gasoline ie petrol Supposing you discover a natural petrol in a piece of property it is there in great quantity What will you do It needs no refinery It has been refined You need only to mount a pumping machine Will you not sell all you have and buy the land build fillinggasoline station there You need the wisdom to do so Wisdom is one of the 7 gifts of the Holy Spirit So let us first seek the wisdom that comes from God God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it NB 1 We are organizing Marriage Encounter Parish Based Please
