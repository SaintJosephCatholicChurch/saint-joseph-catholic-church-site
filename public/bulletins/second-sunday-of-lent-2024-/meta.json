weekend Feb 24th 25th the Church celebrates the Second Sunday in Lent Over our three year lectionary cycle for Sunday liturgies we hear from all three accounts of the Transfiguration in the Synoptic Gospels Matthew Mark and Luke on the Second Sunday of Lent Similar to the grace He bestows on the three who follow Him up the mountain the account of the Transfiguration is meant to prepare us all for all that lies ahead as we continue in our Lenten journey and walk these forty days with the Lord Holy Hour Family Time We have added a new addition to our normal First Friday Adoration schedule From 1:00PM to 2:00PM this hour slot is now marked as a Young Family Holy Hour Though open to all this time is specifically designed for families with younger children As it may be difficult at times for younger children to sit in quiet prayer throughout a full holy hour this hour anticipates an open environment where our young parishioners are able to freely move about and give them the chance to call out to the Lord as joyously as they would like This addition to our schedule comes from the suggestions of a number of our young families That being said it is worth remembering that all regardless of age are always welcome at any hour to spend time with our Lord during our monthly First Friday Adoration and our weekly times of adoration Tuesdays from 700 8:00AM Wednesdays from 600 7:00PM Going even further please keep in mind especially during this Lenten season that the Church is open at all hours both night and day for personal prayer How beautiful it is that all of us God's beloved children can come before Him in prayer As I've shared before it was a great joy to learn while studying our parish history that our parish motto is Let the children come to me and do not prevent them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these Matthew 1914 May we continue doing all that we can as a parish family to be open and supportive of one another and rejoice as we see and hear our parish continuing to grow and our Faith continuing to be spread from one generation to the next Updates from the Pilgrimage By the time that you are reading this our pilgrims and I will have just traveled from Assisi to Florence As we departed Assisi we made a short stop at the Assisi War Cemetery This cemetery is the final resting place of over 900 allied soldiers who gave their lives during the liberation of Assisi in the Second World War Here we had the opportunity to offer prayers in gratitude for our veterans and ask the Lord's blessing for peace in the world Following this brief stop our pilgrimage continued as we arrived in Florence later in the evening As the 10 AM Sunday morning Mass is beginning here at St Joseph's we will be gathered at the same time 4 PM in Italy at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Florence to offer Mass Though we may be apart by distance we remain united as one in prayer Our Mass at the Church of the Holy Trinity is being offered for our entire parish family Monday will see us depart Florence for stops in Siena and Orvieto as we visit the sites of two different eucharistic miracles In the evening we will find ourselves back in Rome for the remainder of our trip On Tuesday evening we hope to be joined by our two diocesan priests and two seminarians currently studying in Rome for our final evening in Rome before beginning our journey back home to Bluffton early Wednesday morning Once we have returned I hope that we can offer an evening with our pilgrims to share their experiences with our parish family Part of the joy of a pilgrimage is not only the experiences that were had but the chance to share these experiences with others I look forward to hearing the graces that our pilgrims received at these eucharistic sites as a way of helping our entire parish grow in excitement for the ongoing eucharistic revival In Christ Fr David PARISH CALENDAR Sat Feb 24 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sun Feb 25 Mass 7:30am Mass
