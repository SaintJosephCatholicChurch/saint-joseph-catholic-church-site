this weekend are meant to remind us of a simple truth We are utterly dependent on Jesus Christ every moment of our lives This means that from the very beginning to the very end of our lives whether we know it or not we rely on the grace of God This message is meant to be one of comfort That no matter what we may face God Himself is always with us and is al ways guiding us Our first reading from the Book of Wisdom Wis 11315 22324 was writ ten only several decades before Jesus birth In it we hear the powerful mes sage that God did not make death Wis 113 By death the author is speak ing of separation from God God never desired man to be separated from Him Through Original Sin however death enters the world and through our own choice we can be separated from God It is in those moments when we find ourselves lost in sin that we find ourselves separated from God For it is in sin that we choose to no longer live for God or one another but only for ourselves The remedy to this selfishness is found in our second reading from St Paul 2 Cor 87 9 1315 In the example given to us by our blessed Lord we see that He has chosen to live not for Himself but for each of us As St Paul explains Jesus enters into our poverty taking upon Himself our human nature so that we ourselves may be united to Him in His divinity He thinks not of Himself but only for us Selfishness is defeated by selfgift In those moments when our love for another whether spouse parent child or friend goes beyond our love for ourselves In our Gospel reading Mk 52143 then we see this love for one another re flected in the synagogue official Jairus Jairus seeks out Jesus not for his own sake but for the sake of his daughter who is dying Jesus in recognizing Jairus cry responds When all seems lost and Jairus hears those devastating words Your daughter has died Jesus is not deterred As Jairus asked for His help Jesus now asks for his faith And faith in Jesus Christ is never wasted Jesus in the face of impossible raises Jairus daughter We are truly and utterly dependent on Jesus Christ for every moment of our lives Let us always turn to Him at every moment to seek His guidance and His love In our prayer we turn away from looking only at ourselves and in stead unite ourselves in relationship to Jesus And in turning outward towards Jesus we also begin to see Him in each other Our faith will never be wasted Jesus always responds Perhaps not in the way we expect but in the way that will ultimately lead us to the heavenly Kingdom Faithfully in Christ Fr David SCRIPTUREMASS READINGS FOR THE
