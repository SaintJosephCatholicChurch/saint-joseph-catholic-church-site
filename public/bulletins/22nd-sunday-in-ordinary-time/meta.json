  "text": "WENTY ECOND UNDAY IN RDINARY IME August 30 2020 This weekend August 29th30th the Church celebrates the 22nd Sunday in Ordinary Time Following immediately after the Confession of St Peter You are the Messiah the Son of the living God and St Peter receiving the keys to the kingdom of heaven Matthew 161320 Jesus now speaks of His coming Passion and what it will mean to follow Him St Peter and the Apostles cannot fully understand what Jesus is saying The Twelve are expecting our blessed Lord to bring about a worldly kingdom which would preclude His suffering and death Ultimately they will not fully understand what He is saying until they encounter the risen Lord following His Passion Death and Resurrection Often our Blessed Lord works in ways that we would have never expected When we invite Jesus into our lives this means trusting in His ways And often it seems quite paradoxical This can be seen very clearly in the call to disciple ship Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me Choosing the Cross would seem utter foolishness and would make no sense if the Cross itself was the end But in faith we know that there is something even greater The Cross is not the end There is that which lies beyond the Cross itself The Heavenly Kingdom In the Cross of Jesus Christ we find true freedom For it is in the Cross where we deny ourselves that we open ourselves to God and to His plan for our lives This does mean facing trials in this life but we never face them alone There is no cross to bear that Christ has not already born for us and does not now bear with us Pope St John Paul II By embracing the Cross only then are we truly able to live Parish Updates Our Religious Education Classes for Kindergarten through High School are set to
