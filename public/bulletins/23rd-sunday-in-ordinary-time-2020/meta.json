  "text": "WENTY HIRD UNDAY IN RDINARY IME September 6 2020 Having spent the entire month of August preparing this weekend September 5th6th finally brings us into the fourth great discourse of St Matthews Gospel The Discourse on the Church In this portion of the discourse our blessed Lord speaks on how to approach members of the Church who have sinned and offer them correction Matthew 181518 as well as the efficacy of prayer offered in His name Matthew 181920 This discourse will continue next week as we hear about the forgiveness that must be repeatedly extended to sinful members who repent Matthew 1821 35 When speaking of the different approaches to fraternal correction our blessed Lord makes use of the term the Church This term is used in the sense of a social structure and an actual community one that is visible and directly dependent on Him and His twelve apostles and their successors These are the sames successors who are headed by St Peter who himself has been given by our blessed Lord the allembracing power of the keys Matthew 161819 and they have a spiritual authority that God Himself backs up Among this authority is that of forgiving or retaining sins of receiving people into the Church or if necessary cutting them off from communion with the Church This is a remarkable power given by Jesus to the hierarchy and is beautifully found in the Sacrament of Confession It has been protected by a special kind of divine providence in the form of Jesus continuous presence in the Church and the Holy Spirits support of its hierarchical Magisterium This is followed by the passage Matthew 181920 in which Jesus promises to be present whenever a number of Christians come together to pray Through our baptism we have become members of the Body of Christ the Church 1 Corinthians 121213 And as St Joan of Arc declared in the 15th Century About Jesus Christ and the Church I simply know theyre just one thing and we shouldnt complicate the matter Therefore wherever the Body is gathered so is the Head found 34th Annual Bishops Appeal and Parish Bulletins As announced last weekend we are about to start the 34th Annual Bishops Appeal Spreading the Light of
