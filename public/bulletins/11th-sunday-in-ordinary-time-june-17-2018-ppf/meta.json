YEAR JUNE 17TH 2018 YR FATHERS DAY WE ARE INVITED TO HAVE HOPE IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all May I once more thank each of you for your wonderful support for the work of God in the parish I am very grateful Continue to do your best in your struggle to do the will of God Be watchful while on your journey to our heavenly home God bless each and every one of you Each one of us has some expectations in life and they are related to hope for fulfill ment though there are some elements of uncertainty in hope As an example a student works hard and hopes for a beautiful future man marries a wife with the hope to create a peaceful family and a loving relationship Parents train their children and hope to be proud of them The uncertainty in hope does not prevent people making effort to achieve their dreams It is important for our hope to be realistic We must not hope too much for such can lead to disappointment and even despair We need to hope for the kingdom of God and thus work heard to realize it in obeying Gods commandments loving God and our neighbor In the light of this hope prophet Ezekiel in the 1st Reading Ez 172224 Reported what God said I will tear off a tender shoot and plant it on a high and lofty moun tain It shall put forth branches and bear fruit and become a majestic cedar As I the Lord has spoken so will I do Do we believe in what God has said If we do then we need to have hope that God will do it for us He will give us the Kingdom if we do our best in obeying and doing His will St Paul in the 2nd Reading 2Cor 5610 Admonished us that if we believe and do well our hope is that God will reword us with good and if we do badly we receive punishment He said Therefore aspire to please him whether we are at home or away For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ so that each may re ceive recompense according to what he or she did in the body whether good or evil That is our hope In the gospel Mk 42634 The Lord Jesus used parables to compare what the king dom of heaven is like He expressed the hope of the farmer to reap fruits from his farm or garden The mustard seed is sown it sprouts and became a big tree providing shades and branches for birds to perch build their nests and produce fruits for the farmer Every famer hopes to reap from his or her farm So we hope for the kingdom of God if we work for it by doing well Today is Fathers Day and as such I want to use this opportunity to congratulate the fathers on this FATHERS DAY Congratulations dear fathers I wish you Gods special blessings May you love your wife children and neighbors and Con tinue to be the PILLAR of your Family As you know t he Family is very important in the life of the Church The family is a miniature Church small church That is why we speak to parents in a day like today we celebrate Fathers Day It is special we respect honor cherish care in a special and love our fathers I want to say that every male is a father married or not married Fatherhood is both in the flesh and in the heart So when I say father I mean every male So Fathers Duty in the Family It is the duty of every father a husband to love his wife support the family even at the risk of his life He should stand by his wife and children in all circumstances loving teaching directing instructing guiding advising leading caring forgiving the wife the children and all around him That is what it means to be a father and a husband good father trains his children Sir 3013 says He who loves his son and daughter too chastises himher often that heshe may be his joy when heshe grows up vs 7 says He who spoils his sondaughter will have wounds to bandage Do not be afraid to train and instruct your children It is an inalienable and undeniable parental right to instruct your children Fatherhusband read Ephesians 5 2133 God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it DAD is not defined as the man who makes the child but rather the man who extends his hands and time to help with the childs raising and his heart to love the child through anything BLOOD does not always make you a DAD Being a DAD comes from the heart Happy Fathers Day WEEKEND OF June 2324 2018 CANTORS 500 Debbie Lautzenheiser 730 Donna Geisel 1000 Marita Crawfis LECTORS 500 Mike
