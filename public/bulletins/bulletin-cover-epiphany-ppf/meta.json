  "text": "PIPHANY HE ORD ANUARY 3 2021 While this weekend Jan 2nd 3rd helps to bring us into the New Year the Church celebrates the Epiphany of the Lord this weekend Though this solemnity marks the 12th Day of Christmas Jan 6th its celebration has been transferred by our Bishops Conference to the nearest Sunday The word itself Epiphany comes from the ancient Greek word epiphneia which is a noun and means manifestation This celebration continues our Christmas celebration as it refers to three manifestations of Jesus Christ to the world The Adoration of the Magi the Baptism of the Lord and the Wedding Feast at Cana The Adoration of the Magi or the Feast of the Three Kings recalls the Magi from the Greek noun magoi coming from the East Most likely the Magi were Persian priestastrologers Having studied the stars and known of the Jews hope of a Messiah they are seeking out this newborn King of the Jews This becomes the first manifestation of Jesus to the Gentiles Similarly in the Baptism of the Lord the heavens are opened as the voice of the Father cries out and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove descends upon the Son of God In this act Jesus divinity and our Triune God are made manifest to Israel John 131 Finally at the Wedding Feast at Cana our Lords miraculous turning of water into wine manifests the beginnings of His public ministry This is the beginning of miracles by which He manifested his glory and his disciples believed in him John 211 In these three events we see Jesus Christ made known to the world As expressed by Dom Gueranger writting in his 19th Century tome The Liturgical Year Let us imitate the faith and obedience of the Magi Let us adore with the holy Baptist the divine Lamb over whom the heavens open Let us take our place at the mystic feast of Cana where our dear King is present thrice manifested thrice glorified For your planning purposes our January Discussion Forum will be a Teaching Mass offered both next Sunday Jan 10th from 8:30AM 9:30AM and next Wednesday Jan 13th from 7:30PM 8:30PM Please note a Teaching Mass is not a Mass Instead it is a walk through of the Mass that looks at the various prayers items and traditions found throughout our liturgy Given the nature of the discussion this forum will take place in the Church not the Parish Social Hall Thank you for your prayers wellwishes and generosity during my period of voluntary quarantine Our good Lord used this opportunity to remind me of how truly blessed I am to be with you here at St Joseph Let us continue to pray especially during this Christmastide in a special way for all those suffering from the Coronavirus and all illnesses that they might know our Incarnate Lords healing and love Thankfully as I remained in good health throughout the entire period of quarantine I had the opportunity to spend much time in prayer and with spiritual reading Currently I have been reading The Incarnation Birth and Infancy of Jesus Christ by St Alphonsius Liguori which offers daily reflections for each day of Christmastide If you are looking for a good spiritual book during this time I would greatly recommend this classic Faithfully in Christ Fr David
