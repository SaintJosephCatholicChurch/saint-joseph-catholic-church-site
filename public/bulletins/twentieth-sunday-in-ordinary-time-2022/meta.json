  "text": "14 2022 This weekend August 13th 14th the Church celebrates the Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time At this time we are beginning to see many of our college students head off as they return to school for a new semester As you return to your studies know of our prayers for you and that we greatly look forward to your return home on breaks and at the end of the semester We welcome our two newest Parish Council members Chris Hartman and Sarah McCorkle Chris and Sarah will be joining our current members Beth Gordon Abraham Herr Jeff Miller and Andy Vachon Each member of the Parish Council serves a three year term and together acts as an advisor to the pastor As a reminder Parish Council meetings are the first Wednesday of the Month August May following the 7 PM evening Mass in the Parish Conference Room and are open to all members of the Parish Next Saturday August 20th we are lending the northside of our parish parking lot to Helping Hands for their annual Parking Lot Party Helping Hands a local pregnancy and family resource center is one of a number of charities that our parish supports within our community Though we do not normally allow events to conflict with the weekend Mass schedule the Parish Council approved an exception to this policy in support of this good cause For those attending the Saturday evening Vigil Mass next weekend there will be attendants in the parking lot to help direct traffic Please follow their instructions and thank you for your understanding and patience After Mass I would encourage you to head over to the northside of the campus join the party and help support this resource for our community 2728 In two weekends we will be hosting a Registration and Ministry Fair After all Masses on the weekend of August 27th 28th you will have the opportunity to register as a parishioner or to update any registration information with the Parish Office There will also be representatives from several of our parish groups to speak with and sign up sheets for our various ministries If there is a ministry we do not currently offer but you would be interested in assisting with please let me know This Monday August 15th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary As this celebration falls on a Monday though it is a holy day it is not a holy day of obligation this year Though not a holy day of obligation it is instead a holy day of opportunity Join us for Mass for this celebration on Monday August 15th at 7 PM The return of our Did You Know Campaign puts our attention on one of the more noticeable sacramentals or sacred sign within the Catholic Church The Crucifix Often prominently placed within the Sanctuary and one of the first things you see upon entering a church the crucifix helps us better understand and appreciate our theology of redemption It serves as a constant reminder of Christs love for us and the price of our salvation 1 Cor 620 By His death on the cross Christ conquered sin and death redeemed the world opened the way of salvation for all who would receive it and reconciled his people with the Father cf Eph 213 18 Col 119 20 That is why the crucifix is such a potent reminder for us of what He did on our behalf that dark afternoon on Calvary In the words of Ven Fulton Sheen Keep your eyes on the crucifix for Jesus without the cross is a man without a mission and the cross without Jesus is a burden without a reliever Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday August 13 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm
