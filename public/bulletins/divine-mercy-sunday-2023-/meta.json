  "text": "Second Sunday of Easter or Sunday of Divine Mercy April 16 2023 special Thank You to Fr Dave Ruppert for being the celebrant at our Saturday vigil Mass this weekend while I am away celebrating the wedding Mass of two of our parishioners the now Mr and Mrs Stephen and Becca Vanderkolk at St Mary's in nearby Bluffton Ohio This weekend April 15th16th the Church celebrates the Octave Day of Easter and Divine Mercy Sunday Throughout the past week each day was celebrated as if it was Easter Sunday itself The end of this octave however does not end our Easter celebration but now fully enters us into Eastertide itself Our forty days of fasting in Lent have opened us to fifty days of feasting and celebration throughout the entire Easter season Throughout these fifty days we hear from the Acts of the Apostles In this book of the Bible we see that the story of Jesus continues through the life and mission of His first disciples in the Church In this way we learn that the Resurrection isn't the end of a story but only its beginning The story of Jesus continues even today through the missionary activity of the Church as we Her members continue to bring the Gospel by word and deed to all people The Sacrament of Confirmation This coming Saturday April 22nd five of our Eighth Graders will join with students from St Mary's of the Assumption in Decatur to receive the Sacrament of Confirmation Bishop Rhoades will preside at the Mass and serve as the minister of Confirmation to our students Please keep these five students Josephine Kari Gabriella AnneMarie and Bartolo and their classmates Angel and Sam who have previously received this Sacrament in your prayers Ecce The Love of God Concert Join us on Sunday April 30th at 1 PM in the Church for a free concert hosted by the Ecce Young Adult Choir The choir consists of young adults from the Fort Wayne area and offers a variety of concerts throughout the year Eucharistic Miracles Pilgrimage One of the things I've hoped to do as a priest but not yet had the chance to do so is lead an international pilgrimage That is until now With the end of my studies in sight I've used some of my new found free time to begin planning a pilgrimage for either late Fall 2023 or early Winter 2024 This pilgrimage will take us to Italy for 10 11 days where we will visit a number of cities where Eucharistic miracles have occurred Rome Lanciano Cascia Assis and Siena As we will soon enter into the national year of the Eucharistic Revival this seemed an appropriate theme for such a pilgrimage And traveling in the Fall Winter will move us away from the busy tourist seasons and the hot weather I am still working with and narrowing down various tour groups to try and set the best arrangements for this pilgrimage while keeping it as affordable as possible We hope to have plans set soon If you are interested in learning more about this pilgrimage opportunity please let me know Distribution of the Most Precious Blood Last weekend we resumed distribution of the Most Precious Blood at our weekend Masses Moving forward the Most Precious Blood will be distributed every weekend at our 10 AM Sunday morning Mass with the assistance of our Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion The weekly Minister's Schedule is in the bulletin We do not yet have enough volunteers to resume with regular distribution at our 5 PM Saturday vigil or 7:30AM Sunday morning Masses We are continuing to request volunteers to assist at both the 5 PM Saturday vigil and the 7:30AM Sunday morning Masses If you would like to assist and are willing to be trained and commissioned as an Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion please contact the Parish Office 824 1380 Once we have enough volunteers we will plan to resume the regular distribution of the Most Precious Blood at these two other Mass times Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday April 15 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am
