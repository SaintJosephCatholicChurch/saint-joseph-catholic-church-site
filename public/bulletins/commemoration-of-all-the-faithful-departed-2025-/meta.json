All the Faithful Departed All Souls Day November 2 2025 This weekend Nov 1st 2nd the Church observes the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed or All Souls Day This observation is one that is entirely unique in the liturgical year Though this day is itself on par with solemnities and feast days it is neither a solemnity nor a feast day The very spirit of the day is one tinged with penitence and consolation yet also with joy as we recall the hope of the resurrection even amidst the pain of death Liturgically this day offers several unique differences that are not seen on any other Sunday in the year From the very first days of the Church Sunday has always had a place of prominence and joy due to its connection with the celebration of the resurrection Yet this weekend that celebration is uniquely mixed with aspects of what would often only be found in either a requiem or funeral Mass or during a penitential season such as Advent or Lent Following the celebration of the Solemnity of All Saints on Saturday our liturgical color altar cloths vestments etc were changed from gold to black for the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed At Mass the Gloria a hymn of praise is not sung due to the memorial nature of the commemoration Similarly our unbleached candles and wooden candlesticks return to symbolize mourning and the sense of sober reverence for this day Overall this day is meant to remind us of the profound communion that exists within the whole Church here on earth in purgation and in heaven We do not believe that even death can sever the bonds of charity that are forged in the fire of Christ's love Instead we are compelled by this charity to pray and sacrifice for the holy souls in purgation that await their entrance into the joy of heaven In this moment the whole Church united across time and eternity intercedes in love for Her members awaiting the fullness of redemption Parish Renovation General Updates As previously mentioned we were able to get contracts signed with Shawnee Construction returned from the diocese in mid October Thankfully this should mean that we have completed the last of the administrative processes and regulations we have been navigating over the past several months with our various diocesan committees I will be meeting with the leads from our construction crew and architectural team this coming week as we begin discussing timelines and construction stages Consecration to St Joseph Next weekend we will formally begin our thirty three days of preparation for our parish wide Consecration to St Joseph The books Consecration to St Joseph The Wonders of Our Spiritual Father are already available in the narthex as well as a version for children and families The book is broken into three parts 33 Days of Short Reflections a section of supplemental stories and wonders about St Joseph and a collection of Josephite Prayers I encourage you to take a book with you and begin the daily consecration preparation next weekend If you miss a day just make it up the next These next thirty three days are meant to prepare our hearts through reflection and the Litany of St Joseph to embrace Joseph as a spiritual father If the Lord Himself chose St Joseph to be His guardian here on earth should we also not seek to entrust ourselves to his paternal care Through this consecration we seek to draw nearer to Christ by imitating the virtues of St Joseph his humility silence obedience and steadfast faith May this time of preparation deepen our love for the Holy Family and strengthen our trust in God's divine providence Let us journey together as a parish family placing ourselves under the protection of St Joseph Entrusting ourselves to his care may we learn to listen more attentively to God's voice and respond with the same courage and trust that marked St Joseph's life Saturday November 1 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Joy Andrews Sunday November 2 The Commemoration of
