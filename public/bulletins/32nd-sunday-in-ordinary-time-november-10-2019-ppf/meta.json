country and we remember in a special way all those who have their lives to protect our freedom Know always of our gratitude and our prayers for you and all those who have served special Thank You to all those who helped make our All Saints Day Party on November 1st a smashing success As you can see on this weeks bulletin cover we were surrounded by a wonderful host of Saints thanks to all those partici pating in our costume contest Newly canonized St John Henry Newman who was canonized on Oct 13th of this year took first prize to be canonized means to be formally recognized by the Church as a Saint Upon entering the Church many were even greeted by a special guest Saint St Nicholas the Bishop of Myra It was a truly wonderful evening This wonderful annual celebration would not have been possible without the help of many hands Lauren Andrews and Ann Reifstack did an amazing job leading our volunteers in decorating the Social Hall and organizing the games in the Gym Our Social Committee and Michelle in the Parish Office arranged the perfect amount of food for our parish meal Jeannette Mayer crafted two amazing piatas that were a smashing success And to all those who helped out in so many different ways Thank You Of course we cannot forget all those who participated in our Costume Contest helping make the whole evening a heavenly affair Keep your calendars marked for next year as we continue this annual cele bration What better way to give thanks to God for our heavenly family in the Saints then to join them in worship of God as a parish family at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and continuing our joyous celebration together afterward with this annual party As we see in our readings this and the coming weekend we are nearing the end of the liturgical calendar Our Liturgical Year will end following the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe the week before our Thanksgiving Holiday Then the weekend following Thanksgiving we enter into the 1st Sunday of Advent as we begin to prepare are hearts for the joy of the Christmas season With this ending of the liturgical year in mind our readings this and next weekend and the past several weekends have a focus on the radical difference between this life and the next as we die we hope to enter into eternal life Our hope in the resurrection of Jesus Christ serves to direct and guide every aspect of our life as we prepare for life in the world to come These readings allow for even greater meditation in the month of November as we remember all the Saints and the Souls of the Faithful Departed If you havent had the opportunity to do so in some time I would recommend reading on the lives of the Saints There is such a great array of men and women who have lived very dif ferent lives as theyve sought out the Lord Many of their lives in worldly terms were seemingly failures Yet we recognize them as men and women who are models of Christian virtue and who have gained that which every human heart desires Union with God In the Saints we find great witnesses models and friends who can help us to grow in our relationship with the Lord In these remaining weeks of November I invite you to find a new friend in the Saints Learn about their lives Read their writ ings Talk to them daily For though we may seem separated from them in this life we are never separated in Christ And one day we too hope to enter into union with them and Jesus Christ for all eternity Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF NOVEMBER 1617 2019 CANTORS 500 Leeann Kennerck 730 Donna
