<p>On Thursday, January 9th, we will offer a "Teaching Mass" in the Church from 5:30 - 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>This event is being offered as a part of our Rite of Christian Initiations for Adults (RCIA) Sessions and all are invited to join us to learn more about the Mass.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A &ldquo;Teaching Mass&rdquo; is not an actual Mass. Our daily Mass that day will be offered at it&rsquo;s normal time: 8:00 AM. Instead, a &ldquo;Teaching Mass&rdquo; is a chance for us to walk-through, ask questions about, and explain the various parts of the Mass in a more in-depth manner.</p>
