  "text": "Merry Christmas May the joy and peace of Jesus Christ be with you and your family on this day and everyday To all visitors joining us today welcome Today we celebrate with great joy the message of Christmas That God has become man to dwell among us God is not distant He is Emmanuel which means Godwithus He is no stranger He is Jesus He desires to be in union with us if we will let Him May we welcome the Christchild into our hearts The readings for our Masses during this day will vary depending on which Mass you attend Each of the readings will progress us through salvation history and the story of the Nativity In these readings the good news is made known to us Today a Savior is born for us Christ the Lord Luke 21011 This day is so tre mendous it cannot be contained in a single day The Christmas celebration continues in our liturgical life until the Baptism of the Lord January 13 The first twelve days of Christmas from which comes the song The Twelve Days of Christmas are often called Christmastide and lead us to the Epiphany of the Lord January 6 The octave of the Epiphany concludes as we celebrate the Baptism of the Lord and following this celebration enter anew into Ordinary Time There is much for us to celebrate and rejoice in during these many days May we never forget to spend time in prayer as we continue our Christmas celebrations and truly thank God for that greatest of gifts The In carnation of Jesus Christ May the Strength of St Joseph the Joy of Mary and the Peace of the Christ Child fill our hearts this Christmas Day Fr David The History of the Nativity St Francis of Assisi created the first nativity in the small town of Greccio Italy on Christmas Eve in 1223 Having returned from pilgrimage to Bethlehem St Francis was so moved by what he experienced that he sought to share his joy with the people of Greccio Receiving permission from Pope Honorius III he crafted his lifesized Nativity in a small cave just outside of the city As St Bonaventure relates St Francis preached to the people around the nativity of the poor King and being unable to utter His name for the tenderness of His love He called Him the Babe of Bethlehem Thanking God for You And Wishing You His abundant blessings this Christmas heartfelt Thank You to everyone who sent a Christmas card made homemade cookies and candy gave gift cards and Christmas gifts

minister among and with you God bless and keep you all in His Love Sr Rose Clare What Christmas Means to Me Christmas is a time of year to share joy and laughs with those we hold dear to our hearts It comes in many shapes and actions as we all have different and special ways of dis playing love to one another Christmas itself brings a unique and friendly atmosphere to the lives of those whom celebrate it Some use it as a time to shop for presents and wrap gifts or just spending time with those they hold dear Children may use it as a time to create lists of long awaited presents in hope Saint Nick will answer Often people find contentment in sim ply sprucing up their homes in preparation of the big day These are all ways of actively en joying the holidays However as Christians Christmas is time of rejoicing and reflection Personally I find the merits bestowed on Earth by God can be witnessed in even the most ordinary of fashions Familiar sights such as pearly snow drifts chilled starry nights or warm fires in a hearth remind us of the beauty of Christmas Christmas means various things to me and brings comforting feelings of the season For me it means peace love and forgiveness to be shared among the people of the world Christmas should be used for all of us to remain self less and giving It also means shared festivities with my family Most importantly it means preparation and courteous patience for the celebration of the birth of baby Jesus And with that I wish you all a very Merry Christmas God Bless Mitchel Mayer Grade 12 What Christmas Means to Me by Illiyana Sailors Grade 4 I think Christmas means to be nice to everyone and others and it is not just about presents It is about Love Joy Peace and Kindness The second thing Christmas is about is spending time with our family and the last thing is Jesus Birthday on Christmas What Christmas Means to Us First Grade Religious Education Class Averie Pearson Jesus Birthday getting presents and celebrating Jesus Birthday Mackenzie Bunn You get presents I get to go to my Grandmas house and open presents really fast Macy McNabb Jesus Birthday getting pre sents being nice joy love Jesus and God Christmas in my opinion is about Jesus birth It is like this huge birthday party because we decorate the house just like a birthday We also make and decorate cookies Also it means time off school and work Because who wants to go to school or work on a holiday I know I wouldnt It also means to spend time with Family and put stress and worries aside Family is one of the best things that happened to you so take the time to get caught up That is what Christmas means to me By Adrienne Wagner Grade 3 Christmas for some kids its a fun time to get unimportant little toys but Christmas is not about gifts its about giving and celebrating Jesus birthday The presents are fun and all but the real reason for Christmas is gathering as a whole family and give thanks to the birth of our Lord Jesus When most people think of Christmas they think of lights trees and presents When I think about Christmas I think about going to Church early Sunday morning going to see a lot of family and spending time with my mother Jessica my father Kevin and my brother Eli Wyatt Girod Grade 9 Christmas to me means a time to be thankful for our blessings and to be happy spending time with close and distant family members to celebrate Jesus Christ our Saviors birthday Emma Howell Grade 6 Carl Goodwin 19222008 David Goodwin Douglas Cale Mitch Harnish DUNWIDDIE HEATING PLUMBING AC 8241999 Over 25 yrs Experience
