<p>Out of concern for those who may be susceptible to the coronavirus, especially the elderly and those with compromised immune systems, Bishop Rhoades has dispensed the Faithful from our Sunday Mass Obligation for the next three weekends (March 15, 22, &amp; 29).<sup>*</sup></p>
<p>What does this mean for St. Joseph's? All Masses will still occur as scheduled. If, however, you feel unwell or unable to attend Mass over the next three Sundays, there is no obligation to do so. (Similar to our winter we<span class="text_exposed_show">ather policy, an obligation assumes what is asked of us is possible. If we are ill or are legitimately concerned of being in large crowds given the heightened possibly of transmission of illness at this time, then we are physically incapable of fulfilling the obligation and are dispensed from doing so.)</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>In addition to our normal precautions announced last weekend and considering Bishop Rhoades announcement, we will be cancelling our Religious Education classes (K-12) in between Masses this weekend (March 15). Please keep in mind that Religious Education was already scheduled off for both March 22 and 29 due to the area schools being on spring break. Classes will resume on Sunday, April 3.</p>
<p>Our normally scheduled Lenten services (Soup Supper, Stations of the Cross, Adoration times, Confession times) will continue to be offered as scheduled unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>Let us continue to pray at this time for the sick, for doctors, nurses, and health-care workers, and for an end to this illness. May we ask the intercession of St. Damien of Molokai to intercede for us before the throne of our Lord in heaven.</p>
<p><sup>*</sup>For those who will be unable to attend Mass, you are encouraged to make use of the TV Mass on WFFT TV, FOX Ch. 55 (Frontier Ch. 5 and Comcast Ch. 12) at 10:30 AM on Sundays, to read and meditate upon the readings of the day (<a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usccb.org%2Fbible%2Freadings%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR23ZUDIbXi4jDIMM3tClV5ekRJ_acSCxAYgGj8AtbE8Xe0c38XAmu6k7EY&amp;h=AT3dhasM7Gz2O_k25vD-AZz0729BRCn0jfWoX6r9ZWIhlvyAQMwlxVmSAM0I_CqxPGASWFCjrh3aoXqMjAO0f7InqzYGFW4r_qTzR1nPpYmBLBm4HzglQFNMsD8Efkf551kl3X_WUbmSeTQbQl0XwhcN5MeXMa6NJX6fKoAOZRK6kfXmfm2n7vZdSIFImKBXEGPDaGEbTJeSZRaaodJkQC9y0NnZSqDjqmP6P4VZlsgDbdf3o9nvaQSksZR628WNNDugVmwfViAlnCgdUP_jE5knmZiWZJvQ_y2LQNL_ZwLxpbPBBvZW2cQN7q1GKyX1RDWSPT5r-gWMkw5RTT-YFwx0TXJ9uOO1Tty3LEiT56Q8cVGcmkXm_fLjMVEvr6sewJXK23l4neSmVMSug6wGfx2mInbm9La0YTgdp3Yd_U3dYKi8L4QEiYiQUMk750WMSHDup2YijMDG-k5_bB5ZdZqrFnFa3ryBNh3-Zyh4TjIXmRV6rIVvgO2-HvrHF0aWEJNnRHHBiov9gs4GzuQab5RMzs8H_8PKJDWV953LvEdy0H31ORRl0hqO5eCG7z0GssPODUUwow5qyjplQnkZ0W2LK9dCYaZqUgY2zn3IJX-4XJDB4BaHT12F64_p" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;-U&quot;}" data-lynx-mode="async">http://www.usccb.org/bible/readings/</a>), to pray together as a family, and to make a spiritual communion.</p>
