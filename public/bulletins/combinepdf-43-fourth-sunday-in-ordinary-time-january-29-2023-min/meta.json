  "text": "Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time February 5 2023 This weekend January 28th 29th the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time Liturgically this week will bring us to the Feast of the Presentation on Thursday February 2nd and the last fleeting glimpses of Christmatide As such this will also be the final weekend with our Nativity scene still in the Church Next weekend our view begins to move from the crche to the Cross as we start to discern what penances and pious practices we might observe during Lent in preparation for Easter This Friday February 3rd marks the tenth anniversary of the death of Bishop John Arcy the eighth bishop of our Diocese Bishop Arcy served as our bishop for nearly 25 years 1985 2009 and remained with us as bishop emeritus until his death in 2013 He is buried along with four other bishops of our Diocese in the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception Crypt Our evening First Friday Mass at 6 PM offered ad orientem this week will be offered in memory of Bishop Arcy Feasts of the Presentation and St Blaise This coming Thursday February 2nd will mark forty days since Christmas Day On this day we celebrate the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord when our Lord would have been presented in the Temple by our Blessed Mother and St Joseph in accordance with the Law of Moses as found in Leviticus 121 8 Highlighting the words of Simeon who recognizes Jesus as a light to the nations this feast is also known as Candlemas On Candlemas it is customary to bless the various candles used in the Church throughout the year You are invited to bring any candles that you would like blessed for your home use to Mass this Thursday Among the candles to be blessed are included the candles to be used the following day for the Blessing of Throats on the Feast of St Blaise Bishop and Martyr St Blaise the 4th Century Bishop of Sebastia was imprisoned before being beheaded during the persecutions of the Emperor Licinius According to tradition he miraculously cured a boy from fatally choking while imprisoned In gratitude the boy's mother gave St Blaise candles to light his cell at night during his imprisonment For this reason St Blaise is the patron of those with illnesses of the throat and the blessing of St Blaise is given with two candles We will offer the Blessing of Throats both on the Feast of St Blaise after the Friday morning 8:30AM daily Mass and after all Masses this coming weekend February 4th 5th Liturgical Updates Distribution of the Most Precious Blood At the Eucharist Formation Day in Fort Wayne two weeks ago Bishop Rhoades shared that he is planning to allow the resumption of distribution of the Most Precious Blood in the coming months Though specifics have not yet been announced it is presumable that this practice will be resumed during either Lent or Easter Once we are notified of specifics we will begin the process to schedule Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion to assist with the distribution of the Most Precious Blood Some have noticed and asked why at certain Masses a secondary chalice is prepared on the altar even though the distribution of the Most Precious Blood has not yet resumed One of our parishioners who has given permission to share this can only receive the Most Precious Blood due to Celiac disease This disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the consumption of gluten Sensitivity and symptoms can range in severity In certain cases even consumption of the host which contains a miniscule amount of gluten can trigger a response Though the host after the consecration is substantially changed into the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ the accidents or material of the host are retained As such a secondary or ancillary chalice is prepared and set apart for this parishioner As a precaution against cross contamination of gluten from a shared chalice this practice will continue even after distribution of the Most Precious Blood has resumed MASS INTENTIONS
