weekend March 15th 16th the Church celebrates the Second Sunday of Lent Having heard of Jesus forty days in the desert last weekend we now join Him atop the mount of the transfiguration Mount Tabor Though the Transfiguration occurs immediately before Jesus final approach to Jerusalem or immediately prior to Holy Week we hear of it now near the beginning of Lent to help prepare us for our Lenten journey The Transfiguration is meant to help us journey from one mountain to another Shortly after coming down from Mount Tabor the Lord resolutely determined to journey to Jerusalem Luke 951 and ultimately approached Mount Calvary and the Cross Today's reading offers us an anticipation of what is reflected from the other side of the Cross Yet we cannot receive that crown of glory God's radiance without first going through the Cross The glory of Mount Tabor prepares us for the trials of Mount Calvary The light that shines forth today serves as a reminder that the light of Christ will always defeat the darkness of sin and death This is the hope of our Lenten journey that it is not one made in vain nor without purpose These forty days of prayer fasting and almsgiving are meant to transfigure us to become more and more like the Lord To reflect His light in the world today Last Sunday we joined several of our Catechumens and Candidates for Full Communion for the Rite of Election with Bishop Rhoades at the Cathedral These men and women have spent the past year prayerfully discerning their desire to enter into the Catholic Church We in turn continue to pray for them as they near the Easter Vigil Over the next three weekends we will have a chance to pray over them as a parish family through the Lenten Scrutinies Lent throughout the Liturgy Entering into the Second Sunday of Lent we have already seen how the practice of Lenten observances are reflected even in our liturgy As a parish we fast from many of the joyful elements that normally draw our eyes ears mouths and hearts to the Lord Our gilded altar candles and crucifix are replaced with more somber wooden ones bleached candles replaced with unbleached candles and the penitential color of violet shrouds the Sanctuary Liturgical hymns of praise such as the Gloria and the Alleluia will not rise again from our lips until that night at which we celebrate Christ rising from the grave As we recess out from Mass following the Prayer to St Michael we do so in silence Fasting from these joyous hymns that normally ring from our lips should give us a moment of pause and call us to enter into the silence of the tomb as we reflect on the true cost of our salvation Such liturgical fasting is also meant to help recall to mind the true meaning the practice of fasting The practice of fasting is the means to an end not the end in itself Fasting is a means to heighten our awareness of that which is missing and deepening our sense of gratitude for what we so often may take for granted Fasting assists us as we grow in discipleship as it trains our will and breaks us out of the complacency of the everyday These forty days of Lent are meant to somehow feel different because they are different This journey walked every single year of our earthly life is meant to draw us closer and closer to the Lord each and every year Though our world and our culture may not recognize a difference in these sacred days let us allow the differences we see and hear be a reminder that we are called to something different to something greater to Heaven St Joseph Day On Wednesday March 19th we will celebrate the Solemnity of St Joseph our Parish Patron Don't forget to join us for Mass and Trivia Night this Wednesday as a chance to celebrate our parish feast day together Next weekend we will also continue the practice of having the St Joseph Table in the narthex after all Masses as a small way to celebrate our parish patron Weekend of March 22nd 23rd 500 David Smith 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Teresa Smith 500
