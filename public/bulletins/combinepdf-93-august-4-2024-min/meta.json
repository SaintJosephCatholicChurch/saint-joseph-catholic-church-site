342 9 Eph 430 52 Jn 641 51 Eighteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time August 4 2024 This weekend August 3rd 4th the Church celebrates the Eighteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Having heard the Feeding of the Five Thousand from the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St John we now move towards the Bread of Life Discourse To ensure that we do not lose the thematic movement from physical to spiritual hunger we do skip one section from this chapter Jesus Walking on the Water John 616 21 Though we do not hear this miraculous event of Jesus Walking on the Water at this moment in the lectionary cycle its importance in this chapter of the Gospel should not be overlooked Having fed the five thousand Jesus went away by Himself while the Apostles went across the seas While doing so Jesus appears to them walking on the water and makes that beautiful and reassuring statement It is I Do not be afraid John 620 This moment in the Gospel of St John represents a theophany a moment where Jesus reveals His glory to us Such a moment is meant to prepare us for what is immediately to follow The Teaching on the Holy Eucharist Jesus is about to reveal this greatest of gifts and as we will see all save the Twelve will reject Him because the teaching is hard to accept John 660 Yet His words of reassurance ring true here as well It is I Do not be afraid On Tuesday August 6th the Church celebrates another theophany with the Feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord Though not a holy day this ancient celebration began in the 5th Century before eventually being added to the universal liturgical calendar in the 15th Century This feast falls forty days before the Exaltation of the Cross September 14th tying together the two scriptural accounts of the Lord being lifted up in glory Lifewise Academy Pastoral Guidance Last August I offered pastoral guidance regarding the Lifewise Academy program being allowed in our three public school districts With a new school year upon us and this program expanding its grade levels I wanted to reiterate this guidance As pastor of our parish I strongly encourage our parish families to refrain from enrolling in the Lifewise Academy program As I detailed last year there are a number of concerns and disagreements with the program's content in relation to the Catholic Faith Even with further discussions this past year it has become clear that these issues cannot be reconciled and that the Lifewise curriculum is not open for suggestions or changes For a full review of the various concerns with this program please see our parish website for the explanatory letter from last year We will be resending this letter to all school aged families in the coming week At the request of several families I am also planning to hold a general informational session later this month regarding this issue I have been asked if I could help provide age appropriate responses for our school children so that they feel comfortable responding when they are asked why they are not participating in this program More information on this to come Parish Logo As part of our preparations for our upcoming sesquicentennial celebrations next year we will be unveiling a parish logo in the coming weeks This will serve as a way to help make our parish name more easily recognizable in our surrounding community We will also be looking at integrating the logo into some parish branded items If you have any suggestions please let us know Upcoming Holy Day of Obligation Thursday August 15th As a reminder the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a
