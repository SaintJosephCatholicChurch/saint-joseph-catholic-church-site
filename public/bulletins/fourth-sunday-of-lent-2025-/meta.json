the Lenten season this Sunday is also known as Laetare Sunday or Rejoice Sunday as we are given the chance to rejoice at all the good that the Lord is doing in our lives this Lenten season This name comes from the opening words of our entrance antiphon for this Mass Rejoice Jerusalem and all who love her Given the Scriptural nature of our antiphons it should be of little surprise that this antiphon itself comes from the end of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah In this last chapter Chapter 6610 11 we join with an Israel that is rejoicing in their return from exile and the rebuilding of Jerusalem This rejoicing is meant to continue as we now strive to build up the heavenly Jerusalem built upon living stones Revelation 2118 21 by building up the Body of Christ As we continue to walk with our Elect through the Scrutinies over the next two weekends we continue to take our readings from Year of our three year lectionary cycle This means that this weekend we are hearing the story of how Jesus healed the man who was blind from birth from the Gospel of St John This Gospel account not only has great value for those preparing for baptism but for all those who have passed through these saving waters Like the man born blind all of humanity save for our Lord and His Blessed Mother suffer spiritual blindness through Original Sin St Augustine the 4th Century Bishop of Hippo described this as man turned in on himself It is only in turning outward away from ourselves and towards others that we can begin to see the light Just as the man washed in the Pool of Siloam and gained his sight so we gain spiritual sight when we too are washed anew Though the man was able to see Jesus he did not immediately see Him clearly for who He truly was There was still a journey for him to make before knowing Jesus fully In the same way baptism is not the end of our journey It is only the beginning Though the saving waters of baptism open our eyes we are still yet newborn babes Just as the man must grow in faith to come to know who Jesus really is so must we Our journey is one and the same Parish Penance Service This Wednesday April 2nd we will have our Parish Penance Service from 600 7:00PM During this time we will be joined by six priests who will be offering the Sacrament of Confession throughout the hour I encourage you to make use of this wonderful Sacrament as a part of your personal preparation for Easter Sunday No matter how long it has been since your last confession don't be afraid to come and experience to mercy of God Turning our minds and hearts again to the words of St Augustine we hear The blind man washed his eyes in the pool called Siloam and came back seeing so too the sinner is enlightened when he is washed from his sins in the tears of Confession Tracts on the Gospel of John Tract 44 Through this great Sacrament we are not only restored to full communion with the Lord but regain a spiritual clarity which we had been blinded from by sin Passiontide and Palm Sunday Next weekend we enter into the two last weekends of our Lenten season Traditionally these last two weekends are known as Passiontide as we focus our gaze more intently on our Lord's coming Passion For this reason our statuary and crucifixes will be veiled starting next weekend as is our long standing parish custom During these last two weekends we choose even to fast from things of beauty so that our minds may more clearly focus on Christ The weekend following on Sunday April 13th the Church celebrates Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion and enters triumphantly into Holy Week We will celebrate the blessing of palm branches at every Mass that weekend and invite you to join in our annual Palm Sunday Procession at the 10 AM Mass on Sunday April 13th Our full Holy Week schedule is also already available on the parish website and will be shared in next weekend's bulletin Fr David Weekend of April 5th 6th 500 Dan Lautzenheiser 730 David Smith 1000 Adult
