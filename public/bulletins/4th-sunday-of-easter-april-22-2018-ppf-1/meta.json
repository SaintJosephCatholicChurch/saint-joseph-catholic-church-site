SHEPHERD SUNDAY WORLD DAY OF PRAYER FOR VOCATIONS JESUS CHRIST IS THE GOOD SHEPHERD SO BE ASSURED THERE IS SAL VATION IN HIS NAME My dear brothers and sisters in Christ the Lord be with you Today is the World Day of prayer for vocation There are many kinds of vocation Vocation to married Life to Sister hood to Brotherhood and to Priesthood We are praying for all these vocations but in a distinct way we are praying for Vocation to Priesthood and Religious Life The Lord Jesus is the Priest per excellence Brethren it is in the name of the Good shepherd the Lord Jesus that we can we be saved if we believe in him He is the Corner Stone rejected by the builders which has become the Cornerstone that carries the building We are threat ened by many conditions in life The worst threat to our life is meaningless existence It is in Christ shall those threatened by meaningless existence or darkness will find safety Christ offers us something to prevent the tragedy of meaningless existence or darkness Those of us who faithfully live out our faith will not break down easily for we have re serves unknown of somewhere IN OUR HEAVENLY BANK Todays Liturgy deals with our safety our salvation So we need Priests and Religious In the 1st Reading Acts 4812 crippled man from birth was restored to good health healed saved Salvation in the name of the Lord Jesus The healed man is a sign onto all of us who are saved in the name of Jesus The Lord is shepherding us through his apostles and priests And so we must pray for vocation to Priesthood and to Religious Life for we need them The responsorial Psalm stated thus The stone rejected by the builders has become the corner stone Ps 11822 it is wonderful Jesus who was rejected by the peo ple is now our Savior also Ps 14635 Isaiah the Prophet pronounced woes to those who put their trust in human beings Is 311 8 So It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in man the Psalmist told us Where do you turn to in times of difficulties and depression or when you are crippled because things do not go the way you want We should turn to the Lord Jesus Christ In the Gospel Jn 101118 Jesus is the Good Shepherd The safety and the salva tion of the sheep is assured when the shepherd is with them The Lord Jesus is the Good Shepherd we his sheep are saved by him So our salvation is assured when Christ is with us He promised to be with us till the end of the world so there is no need to be afraid if we accept to be with him He is always there for us present waiting for us to accept him Thus it is our responsibility to be with him for if we accept him we cannot go astray Everyone is invited to participate in the work of shepherding Gods creation I want to call your attention to the fact that we need to protect and nurture all Gods created things thus shepherding them Every husband will shepherd his family So will every wifemother shepherd her family And every child will shepherd hisher parents brothers and sisters Even a sixmontholdyoung child is responsible to shepherd hisher toys Everyone is called to be a shepherd in different ways So today we are praying for Vocation to Priesthood and to Religious Life for we need them to shepherd us help us direct us to the way of salvation So young people you are challenged to come forward and offer yourselves to serve as Priests and Religious in the Church Our Parish has nobody as a Priest Sister or Brother Listen to the voice of God He may be calling you to Priesthood or Religious Life Please parents fan the fire of voca tion in your children to flame to enable them answer Gods call Young people where are you Do something Every one of us here must have directly or indirectly benefited from the ministry of a Priest or a Religious Think about it Who baptized you It is a Priest Who hears your Confessions blesses you celebrates the Holy Mass for you It is always a Priest So we need Priests and Religious because their services are necessary for our salvation Support vocation to priesthood You can help train Priests Sisters and Brothers Our Bishop Most Rev Kevin Rhoades needs your help to train Seminarians for the Priesthood If your Pastor Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu is not here you will have no one to minister to your Sacraments and sacramental needs Myself standing here before you I was trained by the financial help of an Austrian Blind Woman Anna Schunher may she rest in peace As a blind woman she used to knit socks table cloths and other things and sold them and gave money to my Archbishop She died on August 24 2006 May she rest in the peace of Christ Amen She was not a rich woman but she helped a lot And here I am among you The Church in USA is now benefiting from the generosity of an Austrian blind woman You can see that the Catholic Church is One Family of Jesus Christ Wherever we are or wherever we work in the Church it is in the same One Family of Jesus Christ So let us work together to build up the Church the body of Christ
