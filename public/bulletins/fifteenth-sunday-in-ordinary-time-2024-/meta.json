celebrates the Fifteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings this weekend are united by the theme of God's choice of His messengers As is typical for God He has chosen some of the most unlikely candidates This should of course actually come as little surprise to us when we keep in mind how God has also chosen us to serve as messengers of His good news here and now When we mark the end of the liturgical year every November we do so with the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe This solemnity is a reminder of that which is cried out in Revelations I am the Alpha and the Omega the first and the last the beginning and the end Revelation 2213 Or as we proclaim at every Easter Vigil All time belongs to Him and all the ages To Him be glory and power through every age and for ever Last weekend our bulletin cover highlighted how the whole month of July is dedicated to the Most Precious Blood of Jesus Christ In similar fashion each month throughout the year is dedicated to certain devotions as we seek to sanctify the entire year in and through Jesus Christ This weekend's bulletin cover offers more information on the devotions particular to each month I would encourage you to look into these devotions each month Popular since at least the 16th Century these devotions are meant to give theme to each month as we grow closer to God the Father His Son and His Saints Young Adult Gathering Mark Your Calendars On Tuesday July 30th we will be hosting a Young Adult Gathering at Parlor City Brewery from 630 8:00PM More information to come Special Collection for the VINE Initiative Having had the chance last weekend to hear from Fr Levi about the good work that the VINE Initiative is doing in Nigeria and throughout the world we are taking up a special collection this weekend to support this good cause Please place any donations to support this initiative in the specially marked collection basket at the Church doors In addition to our financial support may we also continue to keep this initiative and all they aid in our prayers To ensure complete fiscal transparency please note that ninety percent of the special collection will go directly to support the VINE Initiative The remaining ten percent is retained by our diocesan Office of Pontifical Missions to assist with administrative costs This office and their staff help to arrange the yearly mission appeal including coordinating visiting missionaries for all parishes throughout our diocese National Eucharistic Congress On Wednesday the four eucharistic processions that began at the different corners of our nation will all arrive in Indianapolis Their arrival will signify the start of the 10th National Eucharistic Congress being held at Lucas Oil Stadium throughout this week and coming weekend With this being the first national congress to be held in our country in eight decades it is truly quite a historic moment for the life of the Church in the United States I will be attending the congress with a number of our parishioners priests and countless faithful from dioceses throughout the country Each day the congress hosts several speaker series and has time devoted to prayer worship and the Sacraments For the speaker series I will be attending talks focusing on two topics Priestly Spirituality and Evangelization within parish life On Saturday a eucharistic procession will take to the streets of Indianapolis following after our eucharistic Lord Finally on Sunday the congress will close with a special afternoon Mass and a message from Pope Francis shared by a papal delegate As with every Mass we will then be sent out to return home proclaiming the Gospel as the Church in the United States is called forth to enter a year of mission throughout the rest of the year special Thank You to Fr Bill Sullivan who will be with us for Masses next week weekend while I am attending the National Eucharistic Congress PARISH CALENDAR Sat July 13 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass
