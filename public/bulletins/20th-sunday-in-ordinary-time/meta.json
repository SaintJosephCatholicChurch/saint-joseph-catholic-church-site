  "text": "WENTIETH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME August 16 2020 This weekend the Church celebrates the 20th Sunday in Ordinary Time August 15th16th And in doing so we are continuing in the fourth great dis course of St Matthews Gospel Having heard of the death of St John the Baptist having experienced the feeding of the five thousand and having met our blessed Lord walking upon the water we still remain in the very beginning of this discourse Jesus is preparing His disciples to learn about the Church here on earth which will be built upon St Peter as we will hear next weekend This continuation in the fourth discourse brings us to todays Gospel reading of Jesus and the Canaanite woman Matthew 152128 This same reading is also accounted for in St Marks Gospel Mark 724 30 though St Mark refers to the woman as a Syrophoenician which would have been the modern term for a Canaanite in Jesus time Taken alone this can often be seen as a very challenging reading as our blessed Lord initially seems to dismiss the Canaan ite womans pleas for help three times The first time Jesus did not even acknowledge her The second time He refused His disciples request on her behalf And the third time Jesus reminds her that He has come for Israel Dogs was a frequent description of Gentiles non Jews in Jesus time The fourth time however Jesus responds with compassion and answers her plea healing the Canaanite womans daughter When speaking of this passage in the fourth century St John Chrysostom highlights the Canaanite womans perseverance and humility When contem plating the full dialogue St John Chrysostom says that Jesus put the woman off three times so that at the fourth time he might crown her as He loudly pro claims woman great is your faith As St Peter would later write our faith increases through trials 1 Peter 167St John Chrysostom continues by em phasizing Jesus proclamation to the Canaanite woman He wasnt simply flat tering her but truly acknowledging how powerful her faith was and because of this how He could respond in her life Taken in the context of the entire fourth discourse and echoed in our second reading from St Paul Romans 111315 29 32 we see the truth of Jesus message as revealed in and through His Church Salvation has come for Jew and Gentile alike Jesus responds to the Canaanite womans perseverance humility and faith In the same way He will respond to all those who approach Him in the same way Jew and Gentile alike Last Friday we received updated directives from the Diocese for our litur gies After reviewing these directives the substantial changes allowed will have little effect on our practices here at St Josephs The majority of the changes regard precautions that we already have in place or are concerning nonliturgical matters that will not affect our weekend liturgies The updated directives can be reviewed on the diocesan website <a href=\"diocesefwsb.org\">diocesefwsb.org</a> under the section Current Diocesan Directives Regarding Covid19 One noticeable change is the allowance of once again distributing bulletins after weekend Masses For the moment we will continue with this weekly mailed bulletinnewsletter In the future we will be looking into the possibility of offering both options continuing to mail out a bulletin for those requesting it while also making them available in the church after weekend Masses As al ways thank you for your patience as we continue to do our best in outreach during this time Faithfully in Christ Fr David special Thank You to Fr Tyrell Alles OSB for offering our Masses this
