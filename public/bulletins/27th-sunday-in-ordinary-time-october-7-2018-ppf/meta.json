TwentyEighth Sunday in Ordinary Time Wis 7711 Heb 41213 Mk 101730 or 101727 27th Sunday in Ordinary Time October 7 2018 Year This past week each parishioner household in our diocese received a special edition of the Todays Catholic The cover story of this edition is a pas toral letter to our diocese from Bishop Rhoades entitled From Crisis to Heal ing Diocesan Day of Prayer and Penance If you have not yet had a chance to read this letter I would highly encourage doing so Our Bishop offers a beautiful reflection on the state of the Church today and how we as a diocese are called to continue to strive after the call to holiness rooted in Jesus Christ Bishop Rhoades has also encouraged every parish in our diocese to begin the practice of praying together the Prayer to St Michael the Archangel after every Mass At the Bishops encouragement this is a practice that we will begin here at St Josephs on November 1 the Solemnity of All Saints We will pray this prayer together between the closing blessing and our closing hymn Over the next few weeks I will include in this weekly column reflections re garding St Michael the Archangel and the beautiful history behind this prayer Our readings this weekend offer a beautiful reflection on the Scriptural grounds of the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony As we know from our own soci ety and world today the Churchs teaching on the beauty of marriage are often found to be quite challenging Yet in these teachings rooted in todays Gospel message from our Saviour Himself we find the true beauty of life and love Though often so challenging it is often these same challenges that bring us closer to God As Paul VI once said marriage is not an easy way of Christian life Rather marriage is a long path toward sanctification In married and family life men and women find together the path to holiness In our first reading Genesis 21824 we hear of the creation of man and woman taken from the second creation account That man being formed by God is not a solitary creature Instead he imaging the Trinity is called to be in relationship For this reason God taking a rib from the mans side cre ates woman In this way man and woman are brought together as helpmates walking side by side As St Berdardina beautifully writes God made woman out of Adams rib which is close to his heart to teach him to love her truly as his companion In this relationship between man and woman we find a union formed by God from the very beginning of time As we hear in our Gospel Mark 102 16 however this union has over time been lost Jesus however reaffirms the sanctity of marriage in citing this passage from Genesis As He does in all things He challenges His disciples towards not what is easy but towards that which will lead us to holiness and to God This can at times cause us great suffering if a relationship falls apart Yet even in these moments our faithful ness is united to Jesus suffering on the Cross as we hear in our second reading Hebrews 2911 As Jesus humbles Himself and makes Himself vulnerable and able to be hurt for our sake so does every couple that approaches the Sacrament of Marriage That willingness to love someone so much that we make ourselves vulnerable before them is the love we see in marriage It is this love that is shared is the reason that we are willing to do this To trust someone so much that we open our hearts to them Sadly this love may not always be returned We do risk being hurt But uniting ourselves to Jesus we cannot allow the fear of hurt to stop us from loving We like our Lord must remain faithful in that love We must believe in the power of the Sacrament to make us holy and to give the grace to face whatever may come It is this faithfulness first and foremost to God which will see us through all trials even the Cross itself May our love for one an other only continue to grow May our love of God always give us the strength to face every trial May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives
