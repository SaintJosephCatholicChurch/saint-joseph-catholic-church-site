  "text": "Holy Trinity Sunday June 12 2022 Our daily Mass time will be 11:15AM this Monday Friday June 13th 17th to accommodate our Totus Tuus Summer Program and our visiting priests special Thank You to Fr Bill Sullivan for serving as our celebrant at all Masses this weekend Next weekend we will welcome Fr John Sheehan who will be with us for the remainder of the summer This weekend the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity Though the Easter season has come to a close and we've entered back into Ordinary Time we will continue to wear white vestments both this and next weekend Solemnity of Corpus Christi as a sign of joy These two solemnities Most Holy Trinity and Corpus Christi that we celebrate naturally follow from Pentecost Sunday Following the descent of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost we just like the Apostles are now sent out to the world In the words of Abbot Rupert from the early 12th Century how fitting it is that today we sing the glory of the Holy Trinity For after the coming of that same Holy Spirit the faith in and confession of the name of Father Son and Holy Spirit immediately began to be preached and believed and celebrated in Baptism May we never be afraid to witness to the glory and love of our Triune God Parish Council Nominations Last year we introduced three year terms for members of our Parish Council to help ensure that our Parish Council has the widest representation of our parish as possible This year Nancy Wagner and Barb Ault will be cycling off of the Parish Council We thank them for their years of dedicated service to our Parish Council and for being great stewards in helping to guide the direction of our parish In the next few weeks we will take nominations to fill these two vacancies for our Parish Council Parish Council Members serve three year terms and are asked to attend a monthly meeting from August through May Meetings are the first Wednesdays of the month after the 7 PM evening Mass The Parish Council serves as one of the main instruments that assists me as pastor in determining and guiding the direction of our parish I would ask that you prayerfully discern if God is calling you or if you feel He might be calling another to sit on our Parish Council Nomination sheets will be included in the bulletin in the coming weeks where you can nominate yourself or other parishioners Once nominations have occurred I will draw lots to select our two new Parish Council Members Three Newly Ordained Priests Last Saturday our Diocese celebrated the ordination of three new priests Fr Brian Isenbarger Fr LeeAllen Fortin and Fr Mark Hellinger For assignments Fr Isenbarger will serve as the parochial vicar of StVincent de Paul in Fort Wayne Fr Fortin as the parochial vicar of St Mary's in nearby Decatur and Fr Hellinger will return to Rome for an additional year of schooling Thank you for your support of the Pentecost Collection last weekend which helps support the education of our future priests May we continue praying fervently for the men in formation for the priesthood and for an increase in priestly vocations especially in our own diocese and from our own parish Faithfully in Christ Fr David For those who have asked my mailing address for this summer is Rev David Violi Theological College 401 Michigan Ave NE Washington DC 20017 MASS INTENTIONS Saturday June 11 8:00am
