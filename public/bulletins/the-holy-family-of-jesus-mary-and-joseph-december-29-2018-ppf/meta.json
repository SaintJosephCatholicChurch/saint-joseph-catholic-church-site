Solemnity of Mary Mother of God a Holy Day of Obliga tion is Tuesday January 1 Celebrated on the octave of the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ we worship our Lord by honoring to His mother This Solemnity is itself an ageold celebration associated with the ancient title of our Blessed Mother as the Theotokos or literally Godbearer This honorific of our Blessed Mother dates back at least to the Council of Epheseus in 431 AD In recognizing Mary un der the title of Theotokos we are asserting the divinity of Jesus Christ The Holy Day Masses will be Monday December 31 at 5:00PM and Tuesday January 1 at 7:30AM and 10 AM We are blessed to be able to welcome this New Year together by honoring our Mother and adoring her son Jesus Christ on this great day as we gather for the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass We hope each family is enjoying our gift to you this Christmas Matthew Kellys newest book The Biggest Lie in the History of Christianity Consider joining our book study over this book that will meet the first three Mondays in January at 7 PM in the Parish Conference Room Also as mentioned at our Christmas Masses our parish has received the special gift of a Papal Blessing This is a blessing imparted by the Holy Father Pope Fran cis to all of the parishioners of St Josephs parchment commemorating this blessing is now hung in the narthex of the parish next to the pictures of Bishop Rhoades and the Holy Father Reflections upon the Feast of the Holy Family of Jesus Mary and Joseph As we continue within the Christmas season today we celebrate the Feast of the Holy Family of Jesus Mary and Joseph Our Responsorial Psalm Psalm 128 ends just before the last verse of the divine blessed May you see your chil drens children In Israel and most of our history the family was the center and joy of life And in our day and age this is something we must reclaim As Jesus Christ is revealed to us on Christmas Day in the midst of the Holy Family so to He is revealed to us time and again in the midst of our own family It is in the family that we are to first encounter the love of God through the love of our parents our siblings our spouses our children and our extended family Our families teach us how to love We so often face the sad reality that every family save the Holy Family falls short of perfectly imaging the love of God in family life Many times we can be faced with many wounded and broken relationships within our own families In the holiday season these difficulties and trials can often be brought front and cen ter as we spend time with our families Yet it is also a chance for healing and al lowing the light of God into the darkness of hurt and division To forgive past hurts does not mean that that relationship returns to normal Normal has changed In stead it means a willingness to try and move forward in the relationship where it is at now In doing so we as St Paul says are loving one another just as Jesus com manded us We have a chance to glimpse the love of God in every person that He places in front of us This starts first and foremost with our family May we honor the Holy Family today by striving to love our own family Changing the world starts first by loving our families for it is in our family that we learn how to love How will we show our love to our family today special Thank You to all of those who helped to ensure our Christmas Litur gies went so well Our church is beautifully decorated thanks to the hard work of our decorating committee Sr Rose and our choir spent many hours preparing the hymns and arrangements
