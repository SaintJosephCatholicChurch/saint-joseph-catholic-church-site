FOLLOW CHRIST From the Pastors Desk HOSPITALITY PATIENCE GENTLENESS TRUST AND FAITH IN GOD IS ALWAYS REWARDED My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all 1 I want to thank you all my dear parishioners You all are wonderful My home Bishop Hilary Odili Okeke was very happy He thanked you all Other friends from other parishes also thanked you for coming out in such numbers The good food The Priests were very happy and surprised that you came out in such vast numbers when it was not on a weekend For all these I say Thank You So Much God Bless You 2 I want also to thank all those who helped and artistically set up those things at the Narthex and the hallway and coordinated the Bible Va cation School It was wonderful I must thank Kerry Tracey and family and Michelle for coordinating this Thanks to parents who brought the children and the catechists Thanks to the children who volunteered and participated May God continue to bless you all 3 Thanks to all who participated in the Eucharistic Cor pus Christi Procession It was very good Keep it up You are not far from the Kingdom of God Take up your cross and follow the Lord for there is reward when you carry your cross according to the will of our heavenly Father For Whoever does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me Cross in this context does not mean a piece of wood or pieces of wood It means difficulty in our Christian Catholic life In the 1st Reading 2 Kgs 4811 1416a woman of influence in the city of Shunem was humble patient with God and charitable although she has no son She was not angry with God for not giving her a son She urged her husband to provide a place for Elisha the holy man of God For her humble charitable action she was rewarded with a son Patience is necessary for our salvation and success in life Please find time and read the whole passage 2 Kings 4837 You will see how goodness and hospitality were rewarded It is good to be a Good Person Have trust and faith in God He will take care of you and all your needs In the Gospel Mt 103742 The Lord Jesus said Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and whoever does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me Whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will fine it And whoever gives only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones to drink because the little one is a disciple amen I say to you he will surely not lose his reward HOME WORK 1 What does a cup of cold wa ter mean 2 What does one of these little ones mean 1 gift from the heart 2 Give without strings expecting nothing in return You see my dear brothers and sister in Christ Hospitality charitable acts trust and faith in God all these are rewarded God promised to reward us Think deep about these To love God more than your mother father your beloved daughter and son are not easy at all You may think that these are easy but when it comes to real action you will surely discover that they are not easy at all They are not easy to come by but not impossible Take the case of Abraham and Isaac his only son of the old age Abraham trusted God with faith and really wants to sacrifice his son But God timely intervened Abraham did not physically sacrificed Isaac but really in his heart mind and will sacrificed him And God rewarded him So be a good person Trust and have faith in God Love your neighbor be generous kind gentle loving patient humble etc Do these and salvation will be yours God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it The amount needed each week to make budget is
