<p>(Updated 18 March 2020)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of the current national emergency, Bishop Rhoades has cancelled all public liturgies in the diocese until further notice. This includes all Masses, public confession times, adoration, etc... The main aim at the suspension of public Masses throughout the Diocese is to protect public health and well-being by preventing the gathering of large crowds (as requested by health officials). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scheduled Mass intentions will still be offered each day through a private celebration of the Mass. These Masses will be <a href="https://stjosephchurchbluffton.org/live-stream-events/">live streamed</a> for viewing on the parish website and/or Facebook page. If you would like your confession heard, please call the office and we'll make arrangements for this to happen.</span></p>
