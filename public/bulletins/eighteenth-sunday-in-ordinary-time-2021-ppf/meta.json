  "text": "IGHTEENTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME UGUST 1 2021 This weekend July 30thAugust 1st the Church celebrates the 18th Sunday in Ordinary Time Our bulletin cover may seem familiar as it is the same one that we used on the Solemnity of Corpus Christi Last weekend you may have noticed that we deviated from our walk through the Gospel of St Mark and have found ourselves in the Gospel of St John We will remain in the Gospel of St John for the next three weekends save for the Solemnity of the Assumption on August 15th If we had continued in the Gospel of St Mark we would have heard St Marks account of the Feeding of the Five Thousand Mark 63044 This miracle is the only miracle to be found in all four Gospel accounts Instead last weekend we heard the account of this miracle from the sixth chapter of St Johns Gospel This week and beyond we will continue to walk through this chapter known as the Bread of Life Discourse From the Bread of Life Discourse we hear Jesus very clear teaching regarding the Eucharist which is His Body and His Blood Jesus Christ is truly present Body Blood Soul and Divinity under the appearances of bread and wine The Eucharist is no mere sign or symbol but is reality For this reason we refer to the Eucharist as the Real Presence of Jesus Christ By his Real Presence in the Eucharist Christ fulfils his promise to be with us always until the end of the age Matthew 2820 As we will hear in the coming weekends many will find this teaching to be difficult and leave our Lord with only the Twelve remaining As difficult as this teaching was to accept nearly 2000 years ago perhaps we take this great mystery of our Faith for granted today Our belief in the Real Presence in the Eucharist dates back to the very beginnings of the Church as seen in our bulletin cover today Our actions and postures reflect this belief from the moment we enter the Church We keep a sacred reverence and silence within the Church proper recognizing that we are on sacred ground as we approach the Lord Himself The sanctuary lamp also known as the eternal flame is kept burning at all hours to signify our Lords Eucharistic Presence in the Tabernacle If able we genuflect towards the Tabernacle when entering exiting the pew before or after Mass as a sign of reverence and respect to the Real Presence Everything we do is to point us to this most wondrous truth Jesus Christ awaits us in the Eucharist He awaits us to receive Him at every Mass To spend time in prayer with Him throughout the day This coming Friday as we celebrate the Feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord Mark 9210 we will have extended adoration throughout the day from 9:00AM 6:00PM I encourage you to come spend time in prayer with our Eucharistic Lord As it is also First Friday we also have two opportunities for Mass this Friday at 8:30AM OF in English and 6:00PM OF in Latin ND OF LASSES AND AILY ASS CHEDULE On Friday my July semester at Catholic University of America came to an end as I took finals for both of my classes The Teaching Office of the Church and Temporal Goods I will have a few weeks break before our Fall semester begins The Fall semester will consist of recorded lectures and allows for greater flexibility in my schedule As such we will be resuming our normal daily Mass times this coming week Thank you again for your flexibility in scheduling over these past two months Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday July 31 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Patricia Stoltz Sunday August 1 Eighteenth Sunday in
