celebrating our Lords birth Thats what Christmas means to me Audrey Mechling Grade 5 When I think of Christmas besides the presents I think of joy and happiness family time and most importantly Jesus Christs birth I think of Jesus life and everything he did for us because He loves us That reminds me to use Jesus as my role model always but especially during the holiday season and to be kind to and love everyone like Jesus does to us Over the years Christmas has meant something different to me but as I have gotten older I know the true meaning of Christmas Christmas is about the gift from God That gift is Jesus Christ Jesus was born to give us eternal life and to take away our sins I am very thankful for everything Jesus did for us and Christmas is a great time to reflect on how it started and everything that was to come Beth Geisel Grade 12 Have fun with friends and family Christs birth give presents and get presents lot of people dont like giving presents but trust me itll make that person feel loved and itll make you feel appreciated for being on earth Luke Miller Grade 3 When I think of Christmas I think of family time and holiday spirit People filled with joy and love Presents under the Christmas tree Kids playing with their presents and a Christmas tree set up and Jesus in a manger bed Annie Herr Grade 2 What Christmas Means to Me There is always a very excited feeling in the last few days before Christmas There is a lot of shopping and a lot of decorating for this time of the year and it can sometimes be hard to remember what Christmas is truly about Christmas is not about giving or getting It is not about the fat man in the red suit Its about the birth of Jesus Christ and how the savior came into the world very important part of Jesus birth is that he was born in a stable That showed that He came to save all people not only the rich but the poor as well Being born on earth showed that He was human but because He is God He was divine too Charlie Andrews Grade 8
