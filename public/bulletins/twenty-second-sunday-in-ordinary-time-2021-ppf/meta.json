now return to the Gospel of St Mark We will continue to walk with the Lord through this gospel until the end of the liturgical year with the Solemnity of Christ the King in November As we continue this walk through the Gospel of St Mark our focus will be on the Christian life As we have already celebrated those great events eg the Incarnation the Resurrection etc that mark salvation history we now see the fruits of these events put into action As Christ has come into the world so now He sends His Church to proclaim the Good News And we as members of His Body proclaim this good news in our very lives PECIAL OLLECTION FOR AITI EPTEMBER 4TH 5TH Bishop Rhoades has asked all parishes to take up a special collection for the residents of Haiti As we have recently seen in the news Haiti has
