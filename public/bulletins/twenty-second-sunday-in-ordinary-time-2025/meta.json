Monday September 1st at 9 AM with Fr Bill Sullivan serving as a primary celebrant This weekend August 30th 31st the Church celebrates the Twenty Second Sunday in Ordinary Time Our first reading comes from the Book of Sirach which we have not heard from in nearly four months This books is one of the seven Old Testament books that were removed from the Scriptures as a part of the Protestant Reformation but has always been preserved as a part of the Catholic canon of the Scriptures since it was set in the 4th Century Considered the last of Wisdom literature in the Old Testament the Book of Sirach offers a mediation upon the overall moral message contained within the Old Testament For this reason Sirach was used heavily in the early Church as a catechetical tool and was even known as Ecclesiasticus or the little book of the Church The title Sirach was eventually settled on for use to prevent confusing this book with either the Book of Wisdom or Ecclesiastes Despite the rejection of the Book of Sirach by Protestant communities its historical prevalence is beyond dispute Sirach was highly respected among both the rabbis of antiquity and the early Church Fathers with various citations found in rabbinical literature and the writings of the Fathers where it is quoted as a part of Scripture The author writing around 200 BC combined long poems with organized collections of proverbs under common themes Oftentimes our lectionary cycle emphasizes how Sirach's ethical teachings are formulated in a way very similar to our Lord's For example both readings this weekend highly prizes humility and stresses this virtue as one key to enter into God's favor In this way the lectionary cycle serves as a reminder that Jesus moral teaching was not a new innovation cf Matthew 517 but a continuation of that which had been handed down to Israel That which sets Jesus apart in His day was not His moral teaching but who He is The Son of God Jesus the Word made Flesh is Himself the very culmination of a profound tradition of moral reflection from God's revelation given to Israel This is further articulated in our second reading recognizing the New Covenant entered into through Jesus Christ This New Covenant invites and draws us into an ever deepening relationship with the Lord This closeness with the Lord culminates in the Most Holy Eucharist Each time we gather at the altar we participate in a foretaste of that eternal wedding banquet in the heavenly Jerusalem In the Eucharist the wisdom of Sirach and the fulfillment of the Gospel are brought together God humbles Himself giving us His very Body and Blood Having received such a great gift we are sent forth to invite others to this same table and share in the Bread of Life Discover Catholicism Thursday Sept 4th
