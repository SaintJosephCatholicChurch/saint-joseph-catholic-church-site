Fourth Sunday of Easter also known as Good Shepherd Sunday This name comes from the Gospel reading which is always taken from one of the parables of the Good Shepherd Traditionally placed on the Third Sunday of Easter this weekend was moved one week later after the revision of the lectionary in 1969 to allow more Gospels of Jesus post Easter appearances to the Apostles to be read This weekend is also known as Vocation Sunday In 1964 Pope St Paul IV instituted the World Day of Prayer for Vocations to coincide with this weekend to fulfill the Lords instruction to pray the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into his harvest Matthew 938 Luke 102 This day is not only meant as a special day to pray for vocations to priesthood and religious life but as a call to form a culture that actively encourages these vocations What does this culture of vocations look like The word vocation itself comes from the Latin vocare which means to call culture of vocations then is an environment that encourages all people to discern and listen to how God is calling them forward at each stage in their life This means not only praying for vocations but being open to the Lord's call in our own lives and actively encouraging one another to that same openness in their lives Our bulletin cover this weekend is a print by Jos Speybrouck an early 20th Century Flemish illustrator Coming into his own after the First World War Speybrouck offers an early example of the Art Deco school utilizing rich colors bold geometry and detail work which gained great popularity in the mid 1920s Much of his portfolio includes images that were used in Catholic devotionals comics and liturgical calendars Our cover comes from a liturgical calendar The Church Year in Images released in 1931 Depicting the Parable of the Lost Sheep from Luke 15 we are reminded of the words of the shepherd Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep Luke 156 With such beautiful meaning this is a print that hangs in my tribunal office serving as a constant reminder that we are called to go out in search of the lost sheep Upcoming Events We have several events to look forward to in the coming weeks This week will see the resumption of our Ask Father Series on Tuesday April 23rd at 6:30PM in the Parish Conference Room This series is an open forum for questions and answers relating to anything about the Faith This is a great opportunity to learn more about our Faith and to even invite family and friends to join us who might have questions about what we truly believe The first weekend of May we will have May Crowning and celebrate First Holy Communion with our First Holy Communicants at the 10 AM Sunday Mass May 5th The following Saturday May 11th at Noon we will offer our first ever Blessing of the Bikes in our parking lot This event requested for a number of years offers all motorcycle riders the opportunity to have their bikes blessed for a safe riding season and is open to our whole community We are also ramping up planning for our Corpus Christi Procession on Sunday June 2nd immediately following the 10 AM Sunday Mass This will be the first procession in our parish's living memory where the procession will go off campus The procession route will be over just half a mile 06 of a mile and will have three different stops along the way as we take Jesus into our community More to come on this exciting event We are excited to host the annual diocesan summer youth program Totus Tuus at our parish over the week of June 16th 22nd Finally we will have the opportunity to join Catholics from throughout the nation for the National Eucharistic Congress in Indianapolis from July 17th 21st With many great speakers lined up and how close this is to us I encourage you to go
