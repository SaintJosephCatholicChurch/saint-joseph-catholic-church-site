<p>Join us for our 2nd Annual All Saints Day Party following the 5:30 PM evening Mass for the Holy Day of All Saints.</p>
<p>A simple meal will be provided by the parish in the Social Hall following Mass. Children are invited to dress up as their favorite Saint for a costume contest. There will be games for children in the Parish Gym and trivia for adults in the Social Hall.</p>
<p>Please sign-up on the poster board in the narthex prior to Nov. 1st. (The sign-up will help us to estimate how much food will be needed for the meal.)</p>
<p>(Children dressing up as a Saint are invited to join us in procession at the 5:30 PM Mass. Please arrive by 5:20 PM to join in the procession.)</p>
