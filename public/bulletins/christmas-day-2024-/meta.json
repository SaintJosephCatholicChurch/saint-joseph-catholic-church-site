  "text": "Christmas Carol By Christina Rossetti In the bleak mid winter Frosty wind made moan Earth stood hard as iron Water like a stone Snow had fallen snow on snow Snow on snow In the bleak mid winter Long ago Our God Heaven cannot hold Him Nor earth sustain Heaven and earth shall flee away When He comes to reign In the bleak midwinter stable place sufficed The Lord God Almighty Jesus Christ Enough for Him whom cherubim Worship night and day breastful of milk And a mangerful of hay Enough for Him whom angels Fall down before The ox and ass and camel Which adore Angels and archangels May have gathered there Cherubim and seraphim Thronged the air But only His mother In her maiden bliss Worshipped the Beloved With a kiss What can I give Him Poor as I am If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb If I were a Wise Man I would do my part Yet what I can I give Him Give my heart Becky Biberstein Michael Green Frances Carr Tom Richhart Troy Cook Bobbie Jackson Kimberly Abney Sydnee Bradburn Lean ne Lee Jeff Tillman and Richard Payne The Nativity of the Lord December 25 2024 Merry Christmas Whether you are a lifelong parishioner or a visiting guest we are so happy that you have joined us to celebrate the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ May the Lord fill your hearts with the joy of His peace as we rejoice together in the birth of the Christ child If this is your first time here at St Josephs or if you are recently returning we would love to welcome you back every weekend throughout the Christmas season and beyond As quickly as it may have seemed that Christmas has come

celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ and even though He was just a baby He was the Messiah The True King Jesus was born in a stable in Beth lehem in the city of David The joy of Christmas is finding Jesus Another thing that Christmas means to me is spending time with family and friends Another thing is rejoicing because Jesus has been born Also that Jesus chose a human loving mother named Mary to protect Him and care for Him Jesus chose a poor family to be His family he didn't want to be rich because He wanted every family to love Him He chose a raggedy stable to be His birthplace It makes me
