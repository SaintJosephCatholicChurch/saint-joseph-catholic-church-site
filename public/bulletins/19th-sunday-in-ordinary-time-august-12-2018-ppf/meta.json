we celebrate the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Our Mass times for the Holy Day are Vigil Mass on Tuesday August 14th at 5:30PM Mass on Wednesday August 15th at both 7 AM and 7 PM In our first reading 1 Kings 1948 the Prophet Elijah fears he is near death As he gives up all hope God responds through the ministry of an angel and provides Elijah bread and water for nourishment This bread from heaven gives Elijah the strength to continue his journey to Mount Horeb the same mountain on which God had appeared to Moses in the burning bush Exodus 314 and revealed His name YHWH I Am These two themes God providing that which we need to strengthen us and the revelation of Gods name would have been on the minds and hearts of the crowds that had gathered to listen to Jesus in Capernum As we enter our Gospel today John 64151 Jesus Bread of Life Discourse continues At the Multiplication of the Loaves the crowds gather ing had their physical hunger satisfied by Jesus Then as we heard last week Jesus challenged the crowds seeking bread to once again satisfy their physical hunger to seek out that which will satisfy their spiritual hunger that longing in their hearts for God And as He continues in our Gospel today Jesus as serts that He is what their hearts have longed for This causes murmuring and dissension among the crowd as it should In His statementI am the Bread of Life Jesus is making two very challenging assertions that would have shocked His listeners That He comes from God the Father and that He is God Jesus claim to have come from God is challenged as the crowds know His origins being known as the son of Joseph Yet Jesus shows Him self different from all others who have come before as He is not simply one God has revealed Himself too but is truly the Son of the Father As the bread given to Elijah strengthens him to continue towards Mount Horeb Jesus pres ence among us strengthens us for our journey He strengthens us by revealing our Father to us and through the Eucharist uniting us to Himself In this com munion with God we share in eternal life As St Paul says in our second read ing Eph 403052 this is to transform us so that we more closely imitate or resemble Jesus in our daily lives Finally Jesus use of the words I am throughout Johns Gospel would have immediately captivated the crowds attention as Jesus takes the revealed name of God given to Moses on Mount Horeb and applies it to Him self To the crowds unless He is speaking truth this would be a form of blas phemy Jesus however gives little time for them to respond as he continues fleshing out verse 51 claiming His flesh as the Bread of Life From this will flow our understanding of the Eucharist which is truly the Body Blood Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ the Son of God Himself given to us for the life of the world In the Eucharist we find that nourishment which is the only thing that can satisfy our longing heart We welcome Fr Lawrence Teteh CSSp as our mission speaker Fr Lawrence is the pastor of St Therese in Fort Wayne and a missionary priest serving in our diocese from the Congregation of the Holy Ghost Fathers in Nigeria So that Fr Lawrence can
