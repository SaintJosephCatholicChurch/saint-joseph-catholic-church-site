  "text": " Twenty  Third Sunday in Ordinary Time    September 4 2022 Join us this Monday September 5th at 9 AM for a special Labor Day Mass Thank you to Fr Bill Sullivan who will be the celebrant for this Mass This weekend September 3 rd 4 th  the Church celebrates the  Twenty  third Sunday in Ordinary Time  A special   Thank You   to all who participated in our Registration and Ministry Sign  up last weekend If you did not have the opportunity to sign  up to receive more information about any of our ongoing ministries or to suggest a new ministry please contact the Parish Office Catholicism Explained  Teaching Mass This Thursday September 8 th  we will host the introduction for  Catholicism Explained  at 630 PM in the Parish Social Hall  This weekly series will dive into a walk  through of our Faith using the  St Joseph Baltimore Catechism  as a basic guide I encourage you to personally invite those that you know would be interested in learning more about our Faith And after inviting them I also encourage you to come and join them along in this journey Immediately following the introduction to  Catholicism Explained  there will be a   Teaching Mass   offered at 730 PM in the Church This walk  through of the liturgy will allow us to look at the various parts of the Mass and gain a deeper appreciation for the Mass as a whole All are welcome to this event  Note  A   Teaching Mass   is not an actual Mass Our daily Mass on Thursday September 8th will be at 8 AM Crucifixes Home Blessings and Tribunal Updates This past week I began to reach out to those who requested a house blessing in addition to our Easter gift of a crucifix Thank you for your patience as I work through the contact list over the next several weeks I plan to visit and bless several homes per week If you did not have the chance to sign up and would like to arrange a home blessing please contact the Parish Office After my first day at the Tribunal it was clear that I will need as I begin to dedicate two days a week to this ministry In addition to new marriage nullity cases that I am being assigned I have also inherited 20 active cases that are all at various stages Thankfully our Tribunal staff has been very welcoming and are a great help to me as I become adjusted to this new ministry As a marriage nullity case nears completion the case file itself can become several hundred pages long As the advocate assigned to these cases I will need to spend the next several weeks familiarizing myself with each case and where it is in the nullity process To do this I will be increasing my afternoon office hours in our Tribunal in Fort Wayne from Tuesdays to Tuesdays and Thursdays for the next several weeks Thankfully again this change will not alter our parish schedule in any foreseeable way Did You Know The Tabernacle and the Sanctuary Lamp When one enters a Catholic church they are never truly alone Given the Catholic teaching of Jesus   true presence in the Eucharist cf John 625  71 the Tabernacle reminds us of the presence of God among us This reality is reflected by the lit sanctuary lamb  or eternal flame  that burns continuously in the Sanctuary whenever the Eucharist is present within the Tabernacle Initially the Eucharist was reserved to provide Holy Communion to the sick and dying and for those unable to attend the Sunday liturgy As appreciation of Jesus   presence in the Eucharist became more developed however Christians then desired to show reverence for His continuing presence in their midst through prayer From the fourth century onward the practice of reserving the Holy Eucharist in churches was a generally accepted practice In our modern day the Eucharist is reserved in Tabernacles throughout the world This reminds us both of Jesus   presence and through and in Him our unity May we make use of this opportunity to spend time with our Eucharistic Lord in prayer In the words of St Josemara Escriv   When you approach the Tabernacle remember that He has been awaiting you for twenty centuries  MASS INTENTIONS Saturday September 3 800 am Special Intention 400  445 pm  Confession 435 pm  Rosary 500 pm Parish Family Sunday September 4 Twenty  Third Sunday in
