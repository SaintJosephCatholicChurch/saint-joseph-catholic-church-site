introductory sessions for the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults or RCIA The RCIA process walks us through a general introduction of the Catholic Faith and is open to eve ryone For those who are not Catholic and wish to learn more about Jesus Christ and the Church it is a welcoming environment for great discussions For those who feel called to enter the Church either through the waters of baptism or if already baptized in another Church by coming into full com munion it will prepare them to receive the Sacraments at the Easter Vigil And for those who are already Catholic it offers a great opportunity to grow even deeper in the knowledge of our Faith Our introductory session for RCIA will be Thursday September 12th from 78 PM At that time we will have a more thorough introduction to what RCIA is and a glimpse at the structure that our weekly sessions and discussions will take over the next several months If you know of anyone interested in learning more about the Catholic please invite them to this ses sion personal invitation from a family member or friend might just be the one thing that one is waiting on to begin this journey If possible offer to walk this journey with them joining them for our weekly RCIA sessions If you or someone you know is interested in participating in RCIA especially those who are considering entering the Church but cannot meet on Thursday evenings please let me know Call the Parish Office 8241380 email me <a href=\"frdavidvioligmail.com\">frdavidvioligmail.com</a> or let me know after Mass If the only thing preventing one from considering to enter the Church this Easter Vigil is the time of our RCIA sessions we will find a solution to this problem Likewise if someone is interested but hesitant about the RCIA process I would be happy to meet with them oneonone to address any questions they might have Faith in Jesus Christ is the greatest gift that one can receive As we have received this gift we are called to share it with others As described in the oracle from our first reading Isaiah 661821 at the very end of Isaiah all peoples and nations are called to enter into a relationship with the Lord This path to a true relationship with the Lord is not an easy path as related in our Gospel Luke 132230 Instead it is a path that will be very challenging and require great effort This path is however the only path worth walking And we are not called to walk it alone walking it instead with one another We are also strengthened along this path by the grace of Jesus Christ This grace is given to us by our Lord through the Sacraments that He has established and passed down by means of His Church May we never be afraid to share these great gifts that have been shared with us May we never be afraid to preach the name of Jesus Christ in thought word and deed And may we never be afraid to invite others into this same relationship with the Lord that we have found in His Church Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF
