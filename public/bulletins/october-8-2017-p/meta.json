TIME OCT 8TH 2017 YR APPRECIATION FOR WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR US IS VERY IMPORTANT My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all I am back Thanks for your prayers and I did pray for you all My journey was smooth and everything went well I thank God for that Once again thanks fro your prayers In our Liturgy this week I want to call your mind to the fact that Teachers and parents sacrifice a lot of their time and talent to give to their children and students the best they must offer They love their children and students I hope that the children and students are aware of these facts and they need to reciprocate adequately by obeying them respecting them loving them and praying for them However the tasks of parents and teachers are not always rewarded for they are sometimes disappointed by the children and students Children listen do not disappoint your parents and teachers for they do a lot for you Know it lack of response can hurt badly Thus in the 1st Reading Is 517 Prophet Isaiah sang a song of beautiful Vineyard The owner of the vineyard has done everything that should be done in a vineyard for it to produce good and plenty of fruits But instead of good fruits it produced bad fruits wild grapes This is painful to the owner of the vineyard Parents and teachers will be equally disappointed if their children and students do not perform well Thus will God feel disap pointed in any of us if we do not produce good fruits God has done everything good that can be done for us He created us gave all the good things your eyes to see the beauty of creation beautiful things around us your ears to hear music your mouth to eat food meat fish chocolate spaghetti pizza and the drinks juice tea coffee wine beer name them We need to be pleasing to God by our charitable deeds Living lives that are marked by love respect forgiveness and holiness In the Gospel Mt 213343 Jesus also used the parable of the vineyard to teach us how we should behave so that we do not disappoint people and our creator God The owner of the vineyard is God our creator The vineyard in the 1st Reading could be you or me The tenants in the Gospel are all of us Reflect on these questions in your mind Now the way you see yourself do you think that you are doing what God expects of you Do you live up to what God expects of you He created you in his own image and likeness As I said above He God gave you eyes to see hands and legs mouth to drink and eat and enjoy the taste of food and drinks He gave you house wife hus band children He gave you your parents and helped you to find your friends God has done a lot for you So he chose you to go and bear fruits that will last Thus it is not enough for you to avoid big sins You should do good things and always be concerned that you do enough of them Let us be appreciative for what God has done for us God bless you Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 We are organizing Marriage Encounter Parish Based Please register quickly 2 We are
