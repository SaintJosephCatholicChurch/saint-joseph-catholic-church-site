  "text": "Fourth Sunday of Easter April 30 2023 This weekend April 29th30th the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday of Easter also known as Good Shepherd Sunday Throughout all three years of our Lectionary cycle we always hear one of the Gospel readings of the Good Shepherd on this Sunday Acknowledging that we are members of Jesus flock we are reminded that each and everyone one of us belongs to the family of God Like sheep we are a part of His fold This imagery is not only one that is pleasant but also reveals much about the life of the Church As we are called to be one flock with one Shepherd this means that evangelization is at the core of the Church's mission As disciples of Jesus Christ we are able to give witness to the generous love of our Father in heaven This love is given willingly through the sacrifice of His Son which is perpetuated in the ministry of our bishops and priests and made present to us every time the sacrifice of the Mass is offered For this reason this weekend was also declared by Pope St Paul VI in 1964 to be the World Day of Prayer for Vocations The purpose of this day is to publicly fulfill the Lords instruction to Pray the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into his harvest Matthew 938 Luke 102 In his own message to mark this day Pope Francis described each vocational calling as a symphony where every vocation is both distinct yet united working together to form a beautiful harmony that emphasizes how we are created by love for love and with love and made for love Congratulations to our 8th Grade Confirmandi confirmed by Bishop Rhoades this past Saturday Having received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit this great Sacrament our Confirmandi have now received all three Sacraments of Initiation Baptism Eucharist and Confirmation This does not mean however that their call to conversion and growth in relationship with our Lord has ended As with all of us it continues now throughout the rest of our lives Next weekend our 2nd Graders will be receiving their first Holy Communion at our 10 AM Mass As they prepare for this wonderful day where they will first approach the Lord in the Eucharist may we pray that their hearts may be completely inflamed with love for Jesus and that we all might be inspired by their example of devotion How beautiful is a child's faith in the Real Presence of our Lord Such faith invites the rest of us to deepen our faith and commit ourselves to receiving Christ in the Eucharist as often as possible Along with the Mass for our First Holy Communicants we will also celebrate our annual May Crowning This celebration will entail the statue of the Blessed Mother in the Church being crowned with a wreath of flowers This serves as a symbol of Mary being the Queen of Heaven and the Mother of God This simple ceremony however carries deep meaning for the Catholic Faith While Mary is revered and celebrated all year long May is a special month to celebrate her as the Queen of Heaven May as Mary's month can be traced back to the Middle Ages where an entire month was set aside for daily spiritual exercises honoring Mary This custom became especially widespread during the nineteenth century and remains in practice until today There are many reasons why Mary is honored as the Queen of Heaven She was a perfect follower of Christ and is considered the crown of creation She is also the Mother of Jesus who is the King of Israel and the universe And of course she is the most important woman of our faith and our spiritual mother Catcheism Chat Wednesday May 17th Due to both our Easter Schedule and the general Parish Calendar I was not able to schedule a Catechism Chat for this month Next month our Catechism Chat will be on Wednesday May 17th at 7:45PM following the 7 PM evening Mass in the Parish Social Hall During this session we will cover paragraphs 527 to 1011 from the Catechism of the Catholic Church as we follow along with the Catechism In Year Podcast from Fr
