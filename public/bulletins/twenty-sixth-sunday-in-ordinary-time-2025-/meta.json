Twenty Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time September 28 2025 This weekend September 27th 28th the Church celebrates the Twenty Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings today continue to task us with many thoughtful questions regarding the challenges of being a disciple including Does it matter how we treat others What does my neighbors suffering have to do with me Can I continue living in comfort while bypassing those around me who are in misery These are but a few of the questions that our readings for this Sunday raise and they may provide some uncomfortable answers As we hear these Scripture passages proclaimed may we invite the Holy Spirit to move us outside our comfort zones and truly reflect upon the answers in our hearts Though the answers may be uncomfortable looking at how we might better love our neighbor is but one of the ways we can grow in discipleship Feast of the Archangels On Monday the Church celebrates the Feast of the Archangels Saints Michael Gabriel and Raphael While Scripture reveals seven archangels Tobit 1215 only three are named Michael Daniel 1013 21 121 Jude 19 Revelation 127 9 Gabriel Daniel 815 16 921 22 Luke 119 26 38 and Raphael Tobit 1215 Each originally had their own feast day but they were combined into one following the 1969 reform of the liturgical calendar September 29th originally marked the Feast of St Michael the Archangel also known as Michaelmas short for Michael's Mass This feast day has been celebrated since at least the early fifth century In preparation for the feast day St Francis of Assisi popularized the practice of keeping St Michael's Lent or forty days of fasting and prayer from the Solemnity of the Annunciation August 15th to Michaelmas in the thirteenth century As Michaelmas falls near the end of the harvest season the practice of keeping St Michael's Lent served as a spiritual discipline to beseech God's blessing upon the coming harvest The feast day itself served as a festive opportunity to give thanks to God for a good harvest The victory of Saint Michael over the dragon served as a main symbol of Michaelmas symbolizing the triumph of trust in God over the fear of the coming winter The image of St Michael on our bulletin cover in honor of the coming feast day bears his shield with the inscription Quis ut Deus This phrase translates to Who is like God This is both a translation of St Michaels name Hebrew Mi ka El and a rhetorical battle cry against the defiance of Satan who himself desires to be like God This phrase serves as St Michael's declaration of Gods ultimate power over and justice against evil Days of Caring Our Knights of Columbus are once again organizing the annual Days of Caring for this October Split over several days this annual community service opportunity allows us to
