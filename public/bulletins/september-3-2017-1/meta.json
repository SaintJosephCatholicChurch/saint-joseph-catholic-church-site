SELFGIVING AND COMMITMENT From the Pastors Desk GODS WAYS ARE NOT ALWAYS LIKE HUMAN WAYS HAPPY LABOR DAY WEEKEND My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all I am not cele brating the Eucharist with you this weekend as has been announced Fr Allam who was arranging for a priest who would have preached Mission Appeal for his congregation as was arranged by the Diocese could not find a priest to do it for him We got information about this on Tuesday August 29 2017 very late He cancelled it So the 2nd collection will be for Rainy DayRepair Fund not for Mis sion Appeal I am sorry for this late information Thanks for your patience and generous gifts Then we welcome Fr Jose and his pastor Fr Bob who accepted to help us within a very short notice Thanks Fr Jose Those who are dedicated to their commitment know that it implies sacrifice Please let everybody pay attention now Take as an example Married people need to think of their mutual commitment in love Religious Sister Brothers and Priests must think and uphold their vows Children and parents must think and uphold their commitment in their family living as people under one roof exercising their duties seriously every day You can now see that Love means selfgiving For Gods ways are not always our ways Thus in the 1st Reading Jer 20 79 Jeremiah the Prophet who was 100 com mitted in his assignment saw himself tricked He said You have duped me Lord and I let myself be duped Jer 207 God cannot dupe any body Jeremiah used this word to express his feeling in his commitment to his relationship with God He saw himself being mocked at every step and he wanted to cut his relationship with God but he could not do it and he said it becomes like burning fire in my heart And in Jer 2329 God said Is my word not like fire is it not like a hammer shattering a rock That is what commitment is like in our life In the same vein Paul in the 2nd Reading Rom 1212 admonished us saying I urge you brothers and sisters to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to God your spiritual worship This is not easy To renew your mind and become perfect need sacrifice and commitment In like manner in the Gospel Mt 162127 The Lord Jesus spoke in clear lan guage what He was to face in Jerusalem death and rise on the third day and that Gods standard is not always the same as human standard Love requires denial of the self and by nature it is sometimes painful Jeremiah in the first reading wanted to stop speaking in the name of God All of us can feel the same temptation in certain stages of our lives Jesus was committed to His Mission It was challenging difficult and painful but he persevered and fought all obstacles on his way to fulfill Gods will To do it He scolded Peter and called him Satan for Peter was forming and becoming a stumbling block for Him If you want to be like Jesus you must take up your cross everyday and follow him If you want to save your life by your own means you lose it but if you allow the Lord to lead you and save you you must forfeit your life for the sake of the kingdom of God Then God will save it for you There is nothing you pay for the exchange of your life There is nothing we suffer here on earth that can be compared with glorious joy in heaven So strive to be committed in your loving relationship with God and your neighbor and God will reward you Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 We are organizing Marriage Encounter Parish Based Please register
