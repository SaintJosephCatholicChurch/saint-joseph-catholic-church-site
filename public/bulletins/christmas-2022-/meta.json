  "text": "The Nativity of the Lord Christmas December 25 2022 Merry Christmas Whether you are a longtime parishioner or a visiting guest we are so happy that you have joined us this weekend to celebrate the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ May the Lord fill your hearts with the joy of His peace and love as we continue celebrating the birth of the Christ child There are always so many people to thank for helping make our celebration of the Nativity of the Lord so beautiful Our choirs who practiced for months to help us lift our hearts to the Lord our church decorators our altar servers who inspire us with their reverence our parish staff Michelle Teresa and Stacey and all those who helped in anyway over these past many days We are also particularly grateful to you for choosing to celebrate with us It is always great to welcome so many guests and to see old friends back home for the holidays If it's your first time here at St Joseph's with us we would love to welcome you back soon throughout the Christmas season and beyond Continuing with our liturgical year's focus on prayer as summarized by the passage from St Luke's Gospel of Lord Teach Us to Pray our parish Christmas gift for all families this year is St Francis de Sales spiritual classic An Introduction to the Devout Life This gift is available for all of our parish households and visiting guests in the Narthex this weekend Born in 1567 to an old aristocrat family St Francis de Sales was the eldest of his twelve siblings Though his father desired that he take on a career within the political life of the day St Francis instead felt the call to the priesthood After a number of years he eventually gained his father's approval and began formation for priesthood After his ordination St Francis would eventually become known for his missionary activity his spiritual writings and would be named as the Bishop of Geneva in modern day France He served faithfully in this role for over two decades Following his death in 1622 he was canonized or recognized as a Saint in 1665 His writings including An Introduction to the Devout Life have been seen as such timeless spiritual works that St Francis was named as a Doctor of the Church in 1877 An Introduction to the Devout Life is a book to be read with pencil in hand It is a book to be read again and again Its aim is to help rid the reader of sin and even the inclinations to sin No one will come away from this work without being profoundly impressed and without being motivated to enter upon the devout life which leads ultimately to God and Heaven May this classic serve to deepen our relationship with the Lord and bring us closer to Heaven MASS INTENTIONS Saturday December 24 Christmas Eve 8:00am Special Intention 4:00pm Robert Mary

a few I especially like going to Church on Christmas Eve Not only do I like the songs and the decorations but it reminds me of the true meaning of Christmas That is what Christmas means to me What
