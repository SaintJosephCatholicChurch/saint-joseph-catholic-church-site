  "text": "Twenty Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time September 11 2022 This weekend September 10th 11th the Church celebrates the Twenty third Sunday in Ordinary Time As a nation we also commemorate this weekend the 21st anniversary of September 11th This tragic anniversary serves as a reminder of our need to constantly pray for peace in our world and reconciliation among all those in conflict May we entrust all those who face war and conflict throughout the world such as those in Ukraine to the King of Peace Jesus Christ Parish Playground Earlier this week the work on our newly installed parish playground was completed With the advice of our Parish Council and not wanting to delay its use we are blessing and formally opening the new playground for us after the 7:30AM Mass this very weekend As this is also the first weekend for our Religious Education Classes we will be joined by each of our RE classes and their catechists for the blessing special Thank You to the many hands that helped bring this project to completion Both our Knights of Columbus and our GIRLs Night Out helped bring this project to reality through their leadership and fundraising efforts Historically our parish motto comes from Matthew 1914 Jesus said Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these This new playground will not only be a benefit to our local community but serves as an exemplification of our motto Parish Picnic Sunday Oct 2nd at 11 AM Mark your calendar Our Parish Picnic is returning this year on Sunday October 2nd Following the

information to come Did You Know Confessionals Over the past several centuries the use of confessionals for individual confessions has been commonplace throughout the Church This practice however has not always been the case in the life of the Church The way in which the Sacrament of Confession has been offered has occasionally changed throughout the years In the early life of the Church publicly proclaimed sins such as apostasy were often confessed openly in church though private confession to a priest was always an option for privately committed sins Still confession was not just something done in silence to God alone but something done in church as attested to in the Didache AD 70 In its present form the use of the confessional dates back to the period fol lowing the Council of Trent in the 16th century Before that time the priest normally administered the sacrament in its private form while seated on a chair in some part of the church and the penitent stood or sat beside him and knelt for absolution St Charles Borromeo the 16th Century Archbishop of Milan was among the first to order the use of a confessional as we know it today in Milan in 1565 Since that time the use of the confessional has remained the primary location for confessions While the proper place for hearing confessions is in a church canon law foresees that for a just cause confessions may be heard in a wide variety of places outside of a confessional For example confessions are routinely heard in hospitals nursing homes and in military situations even on the field of battle Yet the confessional itself still conveys an important message to the Church and society as a whole It communicates that this sacrament is a sacred and privileged place which is to serve as a source of the divine healing that comes from the reception of Gods forgiveness MASS INTENTIONS Saturday September 10 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Joan Scheidler Sunday September 11 Twenty Fourth
