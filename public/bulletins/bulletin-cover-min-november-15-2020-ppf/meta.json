  "text": "HIRTY HIRD UNDAY I RDINARY IME OVEMBER 15 2020 special Thank You to our St Joseph Womens Group for their cleaning and polishing of the pews this past Tuesday Given our frequent sanitizing of the pews after each Mass the cleaning solution has worn away the varnish on portions of the pews This work by our Womens Group will help protect the exposed wood and preserve our pews This weekend now brings us into the 33rd Sunday in Ordinary Time Nov 14th 15th the second to last week of Ordinary Time Next weekend we conclude our liturgical year by celebrating the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe From this celebration we end the liturgical year proclaiming Jesus as our King and enter into a new liturgical year of Gods grace as we begin the season of Advent Instituted by Christ the Church has received seven Sacraments These seven are broken into three categories The Sacraments of Initiation Baptism Confirmation and Holy Eucharist the Sacraments of Service Holy Matrimony and Holy Orders and the Sacraments of Healing Confession and Anointing of the Sick Last weekend our bulletin cover highlighted one of the two Sacraments of Healing Confession This weekend it highlights the other Anointing of the Sick Quite often Anointing of the Sick is confused with Last Rites While many may think that you would only receive this Sacrament as you are nearing death the Anointing of the Sick is a Sacrament with a much wider availability and application It is available to those who are severely ill but also those who are undergoing serious surgery enduring chronic illness and those of advanced age Last Rites is not itself a Sacrament but consists of the Anointing of the Sick Confession if the individual is conscious Viaticum The last reception of Holy Communion here on earth Literally meaning Food for the Journey and the Apostolic Pardon special and final blessing given by the priest through the authority of the Church This blessing offers the departing soul if freed from all attachment to mortal sin a plenary indulgence While Anointing of the Sick is administer to those who are ill Last Rites would be given to those nearing the point of death to prepare them to approach the heavenly gates Thanks to your generosity at the October FishFry and last weekends freewill donations collected after Mass our Knights of Columbus were able to donate 72 coats of various sizes to our area schools and charitable groups Your generosity has helped ensure that those in need will have a warm coat this year throughout the cold winter months Next weekend we will have an additional opportunity to support an other good cause within our community The Bluffton Common Council has approved the installation of a baby box in the city baby box is a safety device that allows a mother in crisis to safely and anonymously surrender their child if they are unable to care for their newborn The city is taking freewill donations to raise the funds 15000 for this cause After all Masses this coming weekend Nov 22nd 23rd which we are calling Baby Box Sunday our Knights of Columbus will be in the narthex to accept freewill donations to support the installation of the baby box in our town All donations collected after Masses next weekend will go to the Bluffton ClerkTreasurers Office to support this vital cause Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday
