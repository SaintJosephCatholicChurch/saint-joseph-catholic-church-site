INVITED TO ESTABLISH THE KINGDOM OF GOD BY LIVING IN THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THE SPIRIT OF LOVE GRACIOUSNESS GEN TLENESS MERCY HUMILITY AND FORGIVNESS My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all Most kingdoms of the world are established through war violence revolution But the King of God is established differently Unlike earthly kingdoms Gods King dom is established through love and justice This is the sort Kingdom the Lord Jesus came and established Thus in the 1st Reading Zec 9910 Zechariah the prophet prophesied about the Kingdom that would be established by Lord Jesus Christ kingdom of peace love and justice Thus he said Rejoice heartily daughter of Zion See your king shall come to you meek and riding on an ass on a colt the foal of an ass Zachariah the prophet set down this prophecy when the country was overrun by the mighty power of Greek Alexander the great He visualized a Messianic King to come The king will en ter Jerusalem peacefully This is the kind of kingdom you will inherit if you live in the Spirit of Christ Therefore in the 2nd Reading Rom 89 1113St Paul said that if any one does not have the Spirit of Christ in himher heshe does not belong God and Christ Heshe who lives in flesh will die But if you live in the Spirit of Christ you put to death the deeds of the flesh which is corruption and decay And in the Gospel Mt 112530 The Lord Jesus prayed to the Father on our behalf Since Christ is pleading for us we shall live and not die He invites us to come to Him and have rest Our work shall light and easy if we work in the Lords vine yard Let us embrace the work of Christ and be saved God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it NB 1 We are
