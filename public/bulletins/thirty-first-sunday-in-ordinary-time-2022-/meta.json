  "text": "Thirty First Sunday in Ordinary Time October 30 2022 As a reminder Daylight Savings Time ends next Sunday November 6th Don't forget to turn your clocks back one hour next Sunday This weekend October 29th 30th the Church celebrates the Thirty first Sunday in Ordinary Time We are once again entering into the last month of the liturgical year In four weeks we will celebrate the end of the year with the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe The new liturgical year will begin the following week Nov 26th 27th as we enter into Advent Our readings throughout these remaining weekends begin to focus on the themes of repentance reparation and the final judgment We are urged not only to repent while we still have time to do so but also to right the wrongs we have done to others that is to make reparation for our actions These themes will continue for the remainder of the liturgical year using its coming end to remind us of our own mortality Though these themes may seem overwhelming they are not meant to be so Instead they are meant to remind us of a simple truth If we walk with Christ He will lead us safely to the end of our earthly pilgrimage and guide us to the heavenly kingdom Just as the year begins and ends with Christ so too must our lives Only in this do we realize that it is not for this world that we live Instead our hearts long for where our true treasure is Or in the words of St Augustine of Hippo You have made us for yourself Lord and our heart is restless until it rests in you Holy Day of Obligation Solemnity of All Saints As a reminder this Tuesday November 1st is a Holy Day of Obligation as we celebrate the Solemnity of All Saints Masses for the Holy Day will be offered on Monay Oct 31st at 7:00PM and Tuesday Nov 1st at 7:00AM Noon
