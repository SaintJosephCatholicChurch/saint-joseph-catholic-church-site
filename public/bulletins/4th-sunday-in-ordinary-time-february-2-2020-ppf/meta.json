  "text": "FOURTH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME February 2 2020 Today the Church celebrates the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord marking the 40th day since Christmas Day We make a brief sojourn from St Matthews Gospel to St Lukes as we hear of the Holy Familys journey to Jerusalem They are met by Anna and Simeon upon entering the Temple both of whom give glory to God upon meeting the Christ Child Just as Jesus is met this day with shouts of joy and gladness so those shouts will be heard again as He enters Jerusalem on Palm Sunday Mark 11111 John 121216 As is seen in the Canticle of Simeon Luke 22535 these shouts of joy are also matched with words of caution Simeon overjoyed to see salvation Himself entered into the world acknowledges the great trials that He will undergo even acknowledging how Jesus trials will affect His mother Mary In a similar way the shouts of Hosanna on Palm Sunday quickly turn to cries of Crucify Him on Good Friday Jesus entering into Jerusalem and into our lives always brings about such a mix of reactions We rejoice in meeting the Savior but also remain steadfast and prepare ourselves to respond to His call of conversion and of carrying our cross Matthew 1624 It is a special joy that this feast falls on a Sunday this year so that we can all celebrate it together and take part in the traditional blessing of candles for this feast day As Jesus is the light of the world John 812 these candles represent that light entering into and shattering the darkness of sin and death John 15 I hope that everyone brought some candles to be blessed ARISH VENTS AND PDATES Mark your calendars On Saturday February 22nd we will have a Parish Game Night at 6 PM following the Saturday vigil Mass Pizza and drinks will be provided the gym will be open and a variety of games will be available This is an evening open to all and I hope to see you there Please see the signup sheet in the Narthex to help provide us with an accurate headcount for ordering pizza Our monthly Discussion Forum will resume this month As we are looking towards repairs and restoration in the church with repairs needed for the damage on the north church wall and updating the flooring in the nave it would seem fortuitous to discuss the direction behind Church Structure and Architecture This topic often can offer many surprising insights into why churches are built as they are and how their structures are meant to aid us in worship As with all things liturgical even the church building itself is meant to point us toward God The discussion forum will be offered both on Sunday February 9th from 845945 AM between the Sunday morning Masses and Wednesday February 12th from 730830 PM after the Wednesday evening Mass This coming Friday February 7th marks the First Friday of the Month As is our parish custom Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament will be offered throughout Friday beginning immediately following the 8 AM Morning Mass and ending with Benediction starting at 5:45PM After Benediction we will offer our monthly First Friday Votive Mass for the Sacred Heart of Jesus offered according to the Extraordinary Form May we take advantage of these many opportunities for prayer during the week Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday February 1 8:00am Special Intention 8:30am Rosary 4:00pm Confessions 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Evelyn Morrissey Sunday February
