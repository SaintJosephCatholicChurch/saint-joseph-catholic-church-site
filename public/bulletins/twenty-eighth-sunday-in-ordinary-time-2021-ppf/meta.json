  "text": "WENTY IGHTH UNDAY I RDINARY IME CTOBER 10 2021 We welcome Fr Bill Sullivan as the principal celebrant for all Masses this weekend October 9th 10th as I am in South Bend to celebrate a wedding and visit with family Throughout this coming week I will also be away Tuesday through Thursday with our diocesan clergy for Continuing Education Days This year our lectures will focus on Catholic Social Doctrine Due to the yearly Continuing Education Days we will not be able to offer our normal daily Masses Confessions or Adoration this Tuesday October 12th through Thursday October 14th We will resume our regular daily Mass schedule this coming Friday October 15th with daily Mass at 8:30AM Please note Both St Aloysius in Yoder and St Marys in Decatur will be offering their normal daily Mass schedules this entire week thanks to assistance from our retired priests PEAKER PPORTUNITY ASTERN ATHOLICISM Next Saturday October 16th Fr David Meinzen pastor of St Andrew the Apostle Byzantine Rite Catholic Mission will be with us for the evening Following the Saturday vigil Mass 6:15PM Fr Meinzen will speak to our Youth Group and our parish in the Social Hall about Eastern Catholicism and his own life as a married priest All are welcome to attend IOCESAN ITURGICAL UIDELINES We have not received any recent updates regarding our diocesan COVID protocols At the moment we will continue with the general precautions that we still have in place Both hand sanitizer and face masks will remain available in the back of the Church for general use Several rows of pews in the front of the Church will remain roped off for those who require greater physical distancing in the pews While distributing Holy Communion I will continue to sanitize my hands prior to distribution and wear a face mask throughout To allow for physical distancing and a singlefile line for the distribution of Holy Communion we will not yet resume the general use of Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion While I know that this adds a few extra minutes to our liturgy may we see it as a chance for but a few extra minutes of prayer immediately after having received our Lord Himself in the Holy Eucharist Our most attended liturgy is our Sunday 10 AM morning Mass If you are desiring a less attended Mass for the sake of physical distancing I would encourage you to attend either our Saturday 5 PM vigil Mass or our Sunday 7:30AM morning Mass If the attendance at our 10 AM morning Mass continues to increase we will open additional pews by removing roped off sections as needed to prevent overcrowding at this specific Mass Please remember as reiterated by Bishop Rhoades back in June those who are ill homebound immunecompromised at highrisk of contracting disease or are direct caretakers of those who are at highrisk are exempt from attending Mass on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation Catechism of the Catholic Church Para 2181 For those who are exempt from this obligation we are stilled called to observe the Lords Day and are encouraged to spend time in prayer and meditate on the Lords Passion Death and Resurrection One way to do this is joining us online for the 10 AM Sunday morning Mass The livestream of our Mass can continued to be found on our website I am also happy to visit our homebound Please contact the Parish Office to arrange a visit
