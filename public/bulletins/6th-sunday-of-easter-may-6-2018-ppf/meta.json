is The Solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord Jesus but in our Province it is transferred to Next Sunday the 7th Sunday of Easter May 13th So Thursday this week is NOT a Holy Day of Obligation Ascension occurs 40 days after Easter and 10 days before Pentecost Thus Pentecost is 50 days after Easter It is worth mentioning that weekdays after Ascension through Saturday before Pentecost is a special time of preparation for the coming of the Holy Spirit No vena Prayer to the Holy Spirit starts on Friday May 11 You can use any form of prayer for the Novena Prayer In todays Liturgy we celebrate love in a distinctive way GOD IS LOVE SO LET US LOVE ONE ANOTHER St Augustine said Love and then do what ever you want Yes because Love does not seek its own advantage or glory It does not take offence or store up grievances It does not do wrong Love is not rude or jeal ous or boastful Love never comes to an end Love is kind patience always ready to make allowance It trusts hopes and endures whatever comes The three readings ex pressed love the Agape love In the First Reading Acts 102526 3435 4448 Gods spirit of love came down on a Gentile family of Cornelius even before they were baptized As we read that while Peter was still speaking the Holy Spirit came down on them and he said Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit even as we have You can see that Gods love is universal he does not dis criminate The Second Reading 1 Jn 4710 announces love Beloved let us love one an other because love is of God everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God God is love and love is God Thus everyone who loves is begotten by God Are you begotten by God Where is God in your life In trying to attain your goals in life where does God fit in Whoever is without love does not know God Only love makes your life meaningful and worth living Whoever is without love does not know God for God is love So pray for selfless love the spiritual love Agape In the Gospel Jn 15917 Jesus gave us a new commandment of love when he said As the Father loves me so I love you Remain in my love Thus let us love one another as He has loved us No one has greater love than this to lay down ones life for ones friends If I have everything or if I can give out all I have and even give my body to be burnt but if I have no love they mean nothing Love is supreme It is the greatest of all virtues It is important to mention that Love is taught You must teach your children how to love It is Agape Love it is the Spiritual love the love that does not know evil the love that does not change If you love Paul what you should love is the Paulness of Paul or if it is Peter it is the Peterness of Peter that you should love Paul and Peter can change but Paulness and Peterness do not change So you need to love for love comes from God and God is love and God does not change To love is not optional It is a command from God So let us love as God loves us God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 Remember that May 19th is our Parish appreciation Dinner All the Coun cils the Teams the Committees all the Ministries and volunteers are invited Please
