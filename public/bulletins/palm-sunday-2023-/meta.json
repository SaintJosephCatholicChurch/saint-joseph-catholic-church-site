  "text": "Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion April 2 2023 This weekend April 1st 2nd the Church celebrates Palm Sunday and enters into Holy Week Early in the morning of this day Jesus sets out for Jerusalem The crowds rejoice at our Lord's entrance into Jerusalem making her streets echo with their cries of Hosanna to the Son of David Emphasizing the desire of the crowds all of this is done in the very presence of the Roman soldiers and of the high priests and Pharisees The prophet Zechariah had foretold of this triumph Rejoice greatly daughter of Sion Shout for joy daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King will come to thee the Just and the Savior He is poor and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass Zechariah 99 This is the glorious mystery which ushers in this great week the week of sorrow In her liturgy the Church has given us this momentary consolation of joy to hail our Jesus as our King before the cries of Crucify Him soon arise This Sunday besides its current name of Palm Sunday has had several other names It is oft called Hosanna Sunday alluding to the acclamation with which Jesus is greeted on His entry into Jerusalem Of more ancient use it was also known as Pascha Floridum or Flowery Easter because the feast of the Pasch or Easter is almost ready to bloom being only eight days away From this latter name the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Len named the modern day state of Florida as he came upon her shores on this feast day in AD 1513 I cannot encourage you enough to take part in the liturgies of the Sacred Paschal Triduum throughout this week Beginning on Holy Thursday evening with the Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper 7 PM the Good Friday liturgy 1 PM an absolutely unique liturgy there is nothing like it the whole year long and the magnificent Easter Vigil 9 PM on Saturday night Throughout these three holy days we find ourselves moving through the entire history of salvation At the end of these three days we find ourselves with a far deeper appreciation of the whole depths of everything that God has done for us The full Holy Week Schedule can be found as an insert in this weekend's bulletin In addition to the three sacred day of the Sacred Paschal Triduum we will also have many other opportunity for both prayer and the Sacrament of Confession Though the world will continue to move along as normal may we as disciples of the Lord not allow this week to go by with indifference Instead may we offer to the Lord the great sacrifice of our time throughout this week and spend what time we can with Him in prayer Devotionals for the Missions Thank You Thank you for your donations of devotionals items for the Missions These items are sent to a religious brother out West Br Dominic Michael FBP who helps to distribute the devotionals to those his community ministers to in their outreach As Br Dominic Michael shares below those who they work with are often hungering more for spiritual items then even material goods We will take up another collection for devotionals in the coming months Br Dominic Michael shared the following We are happy to receive these religious articles We give out these items to the people who come to our food shelf or are on the streets and they love and appreciate all that we have Sometimes they want a crucifix or a little statue or picture more than a bag of food Praise God Thank you for thinking of us and we appreciate your kindness Blessings and prayers for the remainder of this holy season Last Weekend to Name That Bell This weekend will be the last to suggest a Saint name for the old church bell that is currently being restored We have received twenty eight suggestions The suggestions will be narrowed down to four names which we will then have the opportunity to vote upon
