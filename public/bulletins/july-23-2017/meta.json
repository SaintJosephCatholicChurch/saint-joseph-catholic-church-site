JULY 23 2017 YR From the Pastors Desk WE ARE CALLED TO BE PATIENT WITH GOD WITH OURSELVES AND OUR NEIGHBORS My dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus I say peace with you all Patience is very important virtue for our salvation Patience can be compared to a precious flower that does not grow in every garden It needs exceptional care Patience makes us look weak But it is not weakness but endurance and kindness So we need to be patient in dealing with our fellow human beings We should not think of just two perspectives or categories good and evil No human being is 100 bad or 100 good Please do not look harshly upon those who are not in perfect consonance with your opinion Consider the whole situation to get at a better judgement of a person Remember that God has been patient with you Thus in the 1st Reading Wis 1213 1619 We saw Gods forbearance which in troduces us to Gods patience in the Gospel with parable of weeds Listen to this But though you are master of might you judge with clemency and with much lenience you govern us And you taught your people by these deeds that those who are just must be kind that you would permit repentance for their sins And the Responso rial Psalm says it all Lord you are good and forgiving If men were God We must learn from God to be patient with yourself your husband your wife your children your parents your friends and with your neighbor In the 2nd Reading Rom 82627St Paul reminds us how the Holy Spirit comes to our aid because we do not know how to pray The Holy Spirit comes to the aid of our weakness for we do not know how to pray as we ought but the Spirit himself inter cedes with inexpressible groanings Do you hear that Let us imitate the Divine In the Gospel Mt 132443 The Lord Jesus says it all No if you pull up the weeds you might uproot the wheat along with them Let them grow together until harvest then at harvest time I will say to the harvesters First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles for burning but gather the wheat into my barn So my dear brothers and sisters in the Lord be patient Do your best and leave the rest for God He is much much wiser than we are God is all powerful and all knowing He is omnipotence and omniscience but he is mild in judgment for he governs us with great lenience He is in charge He is the judge but a merciful patient loving and con siderate King Please allow God to take care of the creation for He is the Creator God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Remember Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it NB 1 We are organizing Marriage
