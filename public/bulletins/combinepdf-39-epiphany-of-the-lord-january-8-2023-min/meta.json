  "text": "The Epiphany of the Lord January 8 2023 This weekend January 7th 8th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Epiphany which is celebrated on January 6th but in the United States is transferred to the nearest Sunday Historically the Nativity of the Lord was originally celebrated by many Churches on this day January 6th This was changed however in AD 376 when the Holy See obliged all Churches to observe Christmas on December 25th as was the practice in Rome As Christmas Day became universally set on our liturgical calendar this day gained the name of the Epiphany As epiphany means manifestation this celebration recognizes Jesus three fold manifestations to the world in the Magi His Baptism in the Jordan and the Wedding Feast of Cana In the Magi Gentiles approach Jesus bearing gifts In His Baptism the Holy Spirit descends upon Him and proclaims that He is the beloved Son of God And at the miracle of the Wedding Feast of Cana our Lord begins His public ministry Normally the Solemnity of the Epiphany is followed by the celebration of the Baptism of the Lord on the coming Sunday However as both Christmas and the Solemnity of Mary Mother of God fell on Sundays the Baptism of the Lord is celebrated this coming Monday on this year's liturgical calendar This means that our Christmas season will sadly formally conclude tomorrow and we will enter anew into Ordinary Time this coming week With the coming end of the Christmas season the majority of our Christmas decorations in the Church will come down and be stored away until next year We will however leave the Nativity Scene within the Church up as a place for prayer until the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord February 2nd This idea comes from our Holy Father Pope Francis who in a speech made in the Italian town of Greccio described the Nativity Scene as a living Gospel Pope Francis explained When at Christmas we place the statue of the Infant Jesus in the manger the nativity scene suddenly comes alive God appears as a child for us to take into our arms The crib is more relevant than ever while every day many weapons and so many violent images are made in the world which enter the eyes and the heart The crib is instead a handcrafted image of peace This is why it is a living Gospel Taking the lead from our Holy Father I invite and encourage you to spend time in quiet prayer before our Nativity Scene throughout the remainder of this month Christmas is not just a memory It is a reality Just as Jesus Christ has entered into human history so now He wishes to enter into our history into our hearts May we be prepared to celebrate every day as Christmas Day by helping to bring Jesus into the world through our very lives Epiphany Chalk and Home Blessing The cover of this weekend's bulletin offers a description of the Epiphany Home Blessing Epiphany Chalk will be blessed at all Masses this weekend and will be available in the narthex as you leave This powerful sacramental is a centuries old practice that is meant to serve as a sign of our dedication to the Lord In this blessing we are to be reminded every time we see the inscription over the door that our homes and all those who dwell here belong to Christ Upcoming Events Mark your calendars for the various upcoming events here at St Joseph Next Saturday Jan 14th we are hosting the Northeast Indiana
