  "text": "Fourteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 3 2022 Join us Monday July 4th at 9 AM for Mass to begin our Independence Day celebrations by first giving thanks to God for the great freedoms that we enjoy This weekend July 2nd3rd the Church celebrates the Fourteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Today is our first green Sunday in quite a while Having celebrated many beautiful mysteries of our faith both universally and locally now is the time when we get to work and put into practice all that we have celebrated We will now remain in Ordinary Time until our liturgical year once again begins anew this coming Advent in November In a Papal Encyclical or letter released earlier this week on liturgy Pope Francis called us to rediscover the meaning of the liturgical year and of the Lord's Day In the liturgical year we are to see the possibility of growing in our knowledge of the mystery of Christ immersing our life in the mystery of His Death and Resurrection awaiting his return in glory This is a true ongoing formation This is why we are called to fully walk through and live out the liturgical year each year Pope Francis continues showing us how the liturgical year lived anew each year serves as a reminder that our life is not a random chaotic series of events one following the other It is rather a precise itinerary which from one annual celebration of His Death and Resurrection to the next conforms us to Him as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour Jesus Christ This year is meant to guide our year our lives so that we might walk along each day following alongside the Savior Himself The liturgical year of course goes hand in hand with the Lord's Day or Sunday Every Sunday the Church celebrates in the Lord's day the event of our salvation calling to mind the joy of the Resurrection Every Sunday has an initiate connection to Easter Sunday Our Sunday worship is a gift that God makes for his people and for this reason the Church safeguards it with a precept which is our Sunday obligation to gather together for Mass unless legitimately impeded from doing so Why does Pope Francis say that is this obligation important Because the Sunday celebration offers to the Christian community the possibility of being formed by the Eucharist From Sunday to Sunday the word of the Risen Lord illuminates our existence wanting to achieve in us the end for which it was sent Cf Is 5510 11 From Sunday to Sunday communion in the Body and Blood of Christ wants to make also of our lives a sacrifice pleasing to the Father in the fraternal communion of sharing of hospitality of service In this worship we encounter and receive the risen Christ Starting next weekend we will discontinue the use of our individual leaflets at weekend Masses These leaflets were initially created two years ago to provide the weekend readings when the hymnals were removed from the pews With the return of the hymnals the leaflets were shortened only containing the Entrance and Communion Antiphons As we had not yet resumed singing these Antiphons were recited as we are instructed to do so in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal GIRM Though we had resumed singing we continued to recite these antiphons primarily due to their biblical content As Catholics we are called to have an intimate knowledge of God's Word So often we overlook that one way we grow in this intimate knowledge is found in the liturgy Not only do we hear the Word proclaimed in the Liturgy of the Word at Mass but the entirety of the Mass itself whether or not we know it is so grounded in the Word Why then move away from our leaflets Primarily to save on resources each weekend Though we will no longer recite the Entrance Antiphon at the beginning of Mass the priest will continue to recite the Communion Antiphon each weekend prior to the distribution of Holy Communion as permitted by the GIRM Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday July 2 8:00am Special Intention
