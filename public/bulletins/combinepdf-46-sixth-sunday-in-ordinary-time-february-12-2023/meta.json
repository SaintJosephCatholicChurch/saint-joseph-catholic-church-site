  "text": "Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time February 12 2023 We welcome and thank Fr Bill Sullivan for being the celebrant at all of our liturgies this weekend While my initial plans of being away changed I have appreciated having this weekend to focus on thesis writing This weekend February 11th 12th the Church celebrates the Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time Continuing from last weekend this weekend was formerly known as Sexagesima Sunday as it marks two Sundays until Ash Wednesday and eight Sundays until Easter In our full Gospel reading Matthew 517 37 our Lord offers us a subtle reminder of the purpose of this brief liturgical time with this phrase until heaven and earth pass away This world and our present life is fleeting Truly it is passing away We are pilgrims on this journey Or in the words of St Paul Although we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord 2 Corinthians 56 and Our true citizenship is in heaven Philippians 320 We are reminded at this time by the Church that we are living for something greater We are living for Heaven We are to be in the world but not of it Or in the estimable words of St Teresa of Avila The world is your ship and not your home With the great season of Lent quickly approaching may we ask ourselves this basic question Do we still love this present life too much to let it pass away If our answer in the truth of our hearts is Yes in what ways can we begin to let go Lent is the season for change What disciplines will we adopt for these coming forty days to help ourselves let go of the world so that we might live for the heavenly May we discern this wisely and make this our best Lent yet The Roman Canon This weekend brings to a close our review of the Saints listed in the Roman Canon or Eucharistic Prayer I These last seven Saints listed are female Martyrs who endured great suffering and torture for the name of Jesus Christ Due to the accounts of their martyrdoms each gained a strong devotion held even to this day throughout Rome The various accounts of their martyrdoms each share a great commonality Each of the martyrs are said to have approached their death with great joy In the same way their witness and example helped to spread the Faith as people desired to share in this joy that can overcome even death itself John 1633 As stated in the 2nd Century by Tertullian of Carthage The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church Order of Penance Updated Translations Starting on Ash Wednesday February 22nd you will notice a slight change in the Prayer of Absolution as prayed by the Priest during the Sacrament of Confession As a continuation of the changes in the Roman Missal in 2011 our nation's Bishop Conference has slowly been updating the translations of each of the ritual books used with the Sacraments Ritual books offer the approved guidelines and translations permitted for the administration of the Sacraments This year the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops is releasing the Order of Penance the latest ritual book to receive updated translations to keep the text as faithful as possible to the original Latin texts issued by the Church Thankfully the changes to the Prayer of Absolution are minimal effect only the priest and do not alter the basic form of the Sacrament which are the words that bestow absolution upon the penitent I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit The translation changes that will be heard are in the prayer prior to the basic form of the Sacrament The word sent in reference to the Holy Spirit will now be poured out and the word give will be grant As you can see this is truly a very slight alteration of the prayer to keep it more faithful a translation to the original text While not a major alteration the update to the text nonetheless offers a wonderful opportunity to reiterate and teach the importance of the sacrament of penance as a staple for living the Christian life MASS INTENTIONS Saturday February 11 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Ruth Helmer Sunday February 12 Sixth Sunday in Ordinary
