  "text": "The Transfiguration of the Lord August 6 2023 May we keep in prayer all of our students over the upcoming weeks Our local elementary middle and high schoolers are all starting their Fall Semester in the coming days Many of our university students are also beginning to head back to campus as they prepare for a new year Know of our prayers for you and for those who will be away we look forward to your return home to St Joseph This weekend August 5th 6th the Church celebrates with great joy the Feast of the Transfiguration This feast recounts the story of the Transfiguration which is acknowledged in all three accounts of the synoptic Gospels Matthew 171 8 Mark 92 9 Luke 928 36 All three Gospels place this event shortly after St Peter's confession that Jesus is the Messiah and Jesus first prediction of His passion and death The suggestion of erecting tents indicates that it occurred during the week long Jewish Feast of Booths Tradition has held that the site of this revelation occurred atop Mount Tabor which is in the far east of the Jezreel Valley itself in the Lower Galilee region of northern Israel By the early fourth century a church was built on this mountain and dedicated on August 6th feast in honor of the Transfiguration has since been celebrated on this date in the Eastern Church from about that time onward Observance on our western liturgical calendar began in about the eighth century and it became a universal celebration throughout the Church in AD 1456 Liturgically though this feast day may only fall on a Sunday once every few years we are never long deprived from these Gospel readings On the Second Sunday of Lent each year we hear these readings as a part of our normal Lenten lectionary cycle This is quite appropriate in that we are given a foretaste of what is to come in the Resurrection before coming to the Cross On the other end of the calendar this feast also calls to mind the Feast of the Epiphany that concludes our Christmas season On that feast we join with St Simeon in proclaiming the Christ child as the light revealed to the nations And upon Mount Tabor today we find the Christ child grown to adulthood and shining forth all the same as He calling all people to Himself The light of Jesus shines forth throughout history and can never be overcome John 11 5 This past week I was in La Crosse Wisconsin for three days to attend a canon law conference The largest national conference occurs in October at the same time as our diocesan Continuing Education Days meaning that I am not able to attend the national conference This smaller conference held at the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in La Crosse however proved to be a wonderful experience and one that I will be planning to attend annually In addition to reconnecting with a number of seminary and law classmates I also met a variety of individuals representing different tribunals and ministries throughout the country The event covered a number of topics including pastoral applications of canon law medical ethics in hospital ministry and differing parts of tribunal ministry There were also many opportunities for prayer at the Shrine and outside amongst the beautiful Wisconsin scenery Pamphlets in the Narthex We have had for many years now a pamphlet rack in the back of the narthex These pamphlets are offered at no cost by the parish and all are welcome to take from them Over the past several weeks we have started a deep clean of the pamphlets Many pamphlets had been strewn about and mixed in several spots and a number were fairly outdated such as our vocation material We will now be more intentionally updating the pamphlets several times throughout the year Pamphlets now cover three main themes Prayer Apologetics and General Topics The pamphlets focused on prayer will highlight both common forms of prayer and devotions specific to the differing times of the liturgical year Those on apologetics will highlight common questions and responses often asked about our Catholic Faith And the general topics will cover a multitude of pamphlets that you may find of interest Make sure to check them out today Fr David
