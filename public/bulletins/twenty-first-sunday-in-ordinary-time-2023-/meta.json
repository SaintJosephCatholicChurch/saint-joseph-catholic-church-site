  "text": "Twenty First Sunday in Ordinary Time August 27 2023 This weekend Aug 26th 27th the Church celebrates the Twenty first Sunday in Ordinary Time Continuing amidst the fourth narrative of St Matthew's Gospel our Lord is shown preparing for the establishment of His Church with its teaching authority The Church of Jesus is built on Peter Matthew 1618 who is given the keys to the kingdom of heaven and with them the authority to bind and loose on earth This use of keys in the Gospel makes an unmistakable connection with the keys given to the royal steward in our first reading from Isaiah Interestingly the word key is itself only used twice in the Old Testament once in Judges and the other full of our symbolism today in Isaiah The key of David spoken of in Isaiah is on a literal level the key to the royal chamber The steward in question Shebna is a corrupt steward who abuses the key for his own interests Shebna the chief steward is the number two authority in the kingdom Yet he becomes corrupted as he forgets what the authority he has been entrusted is truly for He controls access to the king effectively mediating the king's justice mercy and favor When Jesus invokes this same language and gives the keys to Peter the implications are quite clear This is the man who has His full authority Just as with the ancient royal steward this power given rests in the office not the man As such this power is passed down from person to person It is possible for someone to abuse the authority and be replaced but it is not possible for the authority to just go away For the authority wielded by the steward is not his own it is the authority of the king himself Therefore this authority remains with the office of the steward until the king himself returns Peter and the Petrine Office held in unbroken succession even unto Pope Francis today remains as the steward of the visible Church The papacy serves as a gift given by the Lord to us The gift of visible unity Our union with the Pope serves as a visible and personal guarantee that the Faith we hold and profess is the same Faith first given by the Lord to the Apostles In this gift of the papacy then we see its true purpose and meaning which is union with Jesus Catholicism Explained Series Our Catholic Explained series will start on Thursday September 7th at 6:30PM in the Parish Social Hall If you know of anyone in our community that is interested in learning more about or even joining the Catholic Church please invite them to attend this series personal invitation from a friend or family member goes much further than we might ever realize For those you invite I would also encourage you to join them in attending the sessions and walking alongside them in their journey How beautiful is this opportunity to share the fullness of our Catholic Faith with others and to invite them to encounter the Lord in and through His Church If you know of someone who is interested but the date and time does not work for them please contact me directly <a href=\"frdavidvioligmail.com\">frdavidvioligmail.com</a> to see what is possible General Parish Updates The quick storm this past Thursday knocked out power to our campus for a few hours and as we soon discovered fried the router for our <a href=\"inter.net\">inter.net</a> Thanks to quick work from local Stylus Technologies we were able to replace the router itself several years old with an updated model and have everything back up and running As always thank you to your generosity to our monthly Rainy Day Fund so that we are prepared to address these unexpected issues as they arise We are currently waiting on the concrete work necessary for the return of our parish bell Once the base is poured hopefully in the next two weeks we will be ready to have the bell returned to our parish campus The Verdin Company has completed their work in repairing and restoring the bell and are holding it for pick up until we are ready for it
