IN THEIR MIDST THUS FRATERNAL CORRECTION IS IMPORTANT AND WE NEED IT My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all Welcome to our Parish Picnic It is good that you are here participating in our Parish activities We grow by interacting with one another Enjoy the day I want to call to your minds of something you know already It is about the importance of Family and Social Values dos and donts They are very important They are formed in us from our childhood So sound education is very important for our children Parents please bring your children to Religious Education Classes and to our Parish Youth Pro grams Continue to instruct your children on good morals noble habits Talk to them in a loving gentle voice Children young boys and girls please listen to your parents and obey them and come to our Parish Religious Education Classes and the Youth Programs every Sunday which begin on this coming Sunday Septem ber 17 2017 In the 1st Reading Ez 3379 God is asking us through Prophet Ezekiel to correct one another We are not free not to fraternally correct our neighbor If you see someone in error you should fraternally approach the person and talk with him or her If you fail to give the fraternal correction listen to what God said the wicked or the sinner shall die for his guilt but I will hold you responsible for his death This is a horrible situation He continues But if you warn the wicked trying to turn him from his way and he refuses to turn from his way he shall die for his guilt but you shall save your self You hear that So parents should be more concerned in educating and correcting their children in their early infancy married people and friends should be honest in their love and friendship which demands fraternal correction from time to time as needs arise Government should allow parents to exercise their God given parental rights and duties over their children For children who are either spoiled or ne glected are on their way to becoming bad people or even becoming criminals of tomor row Fraternal correction will solve these impending problems And in the Gospel Mt 181520 The Lord Jesus said it all He said If your brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you him alone If he listens to you you have won over your brother If he does not listen take one or two others along with you so that every fact may be established on the testimony of two or three witnesses If he refuses to listen to them tell the Church If he refuses to listen even to Church then treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax collector You hear what we need to do to win back our brother our sister or our neighbor Just do that and you will be fine And that is why St Paul admonished us in the 2nd Reading Rom13810 thus Brothers and sisters Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another for the one who loves another has fulfilled the Law When we love with genuine love everything will take its normal and proper course and position For love does no wrong So my dear brothers and sisters in Christ we need to sit up challenge ourselves in do ing the good things that please God We need to correct one another fraternally avoid murmuring and gossiping in our relationships Go to a good person for advice someone wiser than you Someone who will tell you the truth about the situation Then before you act seek guidance and direction in prayer from God from the Lord Jesus who is present to us always especially in the Blessed Holy Eucharist Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it God
