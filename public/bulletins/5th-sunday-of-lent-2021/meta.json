  "text": "IFTH UNDAY OF ENT ARCH 21 2021 This Fifth Sunday of Lent March 20th21st is traditionally known as Passion Sunday It marked the beginning of Passiontide which formed a bridge between these last two weeks of Lent and Easter This nearing end of the Lenten season is reflected in our liturgy today which is full of premonitions of Jesus coming Passion and Death These premonitions come to a head in the final line of todays Gospel And when I am lifted up from the earth I will draw everyone to myself He said this indicating the kind of death he would die John 123233 Though the end of Lent is nearing it has not yet come We do not want to become lax in our Lenten observances Quite the opposite As is reflected in our liturgical year we should spend these next two weeks acting in a very intentional manner as we prepare for Easter Passion Sunday leads us to Palm Sunday which enters us into Holy Week and the Sacred Paschal Triduum the three most sacred days of the Church year Our liturgical celebrations intensify over these next two weeks ensuring that Jesus Christ remains our sole focus And as it is in our liturgy so must it be in our life As is our parish custom we have covered the sacred images in the church with purple cloth between this Sunday and Good Friday for the crucifix and Easter for all the other images It might seem odd that just as we begin to turn our attention more intensely toward Jesus Passion we cover up the crucifix The sacred liturgy however frequently makes use of a strategy of revelation through veiling Even though we cannot see the image of the Crucified the veiling of the crucifix draws our attention to it more intensely Frequently what we cant see is what most arouses our cu riosity and imagination PDATES TO THE IOCESAN ITURGICAL IRECTIVES On the Solemnity of St Joseph March 19th the diocese has released updates to our diocesan liturgical directives These updates continue to be made in consultation with several infectious disease specialists Working with these medical professionals and specialists the diocese is seeking to ensure that our parishes are following the safest and most prudent practices as we gather for the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass The full updates from the diocese are available for your review on our parish website The most notable update recognizes that surface and waterborne transmission are not viewed as common means of viral spread With this understanding the diocese has stated that it is safe for parishes to return the use of hymnals and refill holy water fonts Regarding our hymnals they will be returned to the pews after Easter Day as we have already prepared the majority of the individualuse handoutsmissalettes for Holy Week and Easter Day Our hymnals do contain the weekend readings for Mass Regarding holy water we will refill our holy water fonts starting next weekend Hand sanitizer will continue to be provided when you enter the church building Two touchless hand sanitizer stations will be outside of the Church entryway in the narthex This will allow you to sanitize your hands before entering the Church and blessing yourself with holy water We will also continue to provide individual holy water bottles and blessed salt containers in the narthex for use of these sacramentals in your homes Faithfully in Christ Fr David Note The updates do not change the directives regarding social distancing and masking Thank you for continuing to respect Bishop Rhoades directives on these practices MASS INTENTIONS Saturday March 20 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm
