and Joseph 1 Sm 120222428 1 Jn 3122124 Lk 24152 Fourth Sunday of Advent December 23 2018 Year special Welcome Home to all of our university students May you have a blessed and relaxing break and we look forward to rejoicing together in the Nativity of our Lord on Christmas Day With Christmas so near our anticipation for this joyous day may be uncontain able And it should be In just one more day we will celebrate together that greatest of days on which light entered into the world in that most subtle and yet perfect of ways as God became man As God has become a part of the human family we are called to be a part of the family of God for all eternity As we anticipate the celebration of the Incar nation of Jesus Christ we find ourselves right here on the Fourth Sunday of Advent Just as we may be making our last minute preparations for the holiday so we also have the chance these last few hours to prepare for the Holy Day Serene as our Nativity scenes may often seem we mustnt forget that the Christchild entered into a world of noise and struggle He entered precisely for this reason to bring peace to a world so desperately in need of it And He comes to do the same today Many problems still exist within our world and peace so often seems to be lacking Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace is the only one who can bring His true peace into our world and our lives As we continue in this Advent season and prepare for the coming of Christ into our hearts we mustnt be lost in the noise of the world We may find ourselves caught up in preparation for Christmas through shopping parties etc As overwhelm ing as these moments can often become they are not in themselves evil they can be used for good So often they are truly moments that can bring great joy and love into our lives To do this however these moments must always be based in and point us to the Christchild For it is in Him that we see what is missing in our world simplicity innocence and love By keeping Christ as the very heart of our Christmas celebration the noise of the world is transformed into a joyful noise made to the Lord Our readings for this Fourth Sunday of Advent remind us that though Christ mas is only hours away our time of preparation continues even still We must make use of every moment in preparing the way to our hearts for Jesus Christ and to keep Him at the very heart of everything that we do In our first reading Micah 514 the prophet Micah reminds Israel of the coming of the Messiah Micah himself an outsider to Jerusalem has entered the holy city and charged Israel with unfaithfulness to the Lord For their transgressions he prophesies the destruction of Jerusalem To the Israelites Micahs words calls to mind feelings of despair and sadness as they are reminded of the destruction of the Temple during the Babylonian exile For this reason the coming of the Messiah the Son of David is a message of hope for he shall be peace a peace longawaited and desired by Israel We find with great anticipation this message of hope fulfilled in our Gospel reading Luke 13945 Elizabeth filled with the Holy Spirit cries out in praise of our Blessed Mother words we know so well from the Hail Mary as she carries our Lord in her womb an ancient title of Mary is the Theotokos or literally Mother of God Mary as Theotokos is the Holy Day we will celebrate on January 1st As King David danced and leaped before the Ark of the Covenant 2 Samuel 6115 which bears the Ten Commandments Word of God the Manna Bread from Heaven and the priestly staff of Aaron John the Baptist leaps in the womb of Elizabeth as Mary approaches as she carries in her womb He who is the Word of God John 11 the Bread from Heaven John 63040 and the eternal High Priest Hebrews 41416 Peace Himself is about to enter into the world and the world can barely contain itself May we in these last moments of Advent share in the excitement of the com ing of Christ And as Christians who are called to welcome the Lord anew each and everyday of our lives may we share in this excitement always Salvation is near and soon to be here Let us make use of every single moment to prepare our hearts to re ceive Him Praised be Jesus Christ now and forever In Christ Fr David As we approach our Christmas liturgies please extend an invitation to all those you know to join us in our worship of the Lord and the Sacrifice of the Mass on Christmas Eve and Day What greater gift can there be than to join together in praise and worship of God on this most joyous of days WEEKEND OF December 2930 2018 CANTORS 500
