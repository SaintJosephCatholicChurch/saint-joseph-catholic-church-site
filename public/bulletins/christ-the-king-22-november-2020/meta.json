  "text": "OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST KING OF THE UNIVERSE OVEMBER 22 2020 Join us for Mass on Thanksgiving Day on Thursday Nov 26th at 9 AM Come and begin your day with the Eucharist Greek for Thanksgiving as we give thanks to God from whom all blessings flow This Mass will also be livestreamed for those unable to join us in person Over the past week weve received many questions regarding the new executive order from Governor Holcomb After reviewing the order and speaking with our diocese it is relieving to see that the order does not place limits on religious services We will continue offering the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass inperson here at St Josephs keeping to the same diocesan safety precautions we have been implementing since May We will also continue making the Mass available via livestream for all those who are yet unable to join us inperson This raises a great question that speaks to the very heart of our Catholic worship Why do we go to such great lengths with safety precautions to ensure our inperson worship can continue Following these precautions as best as we can we witness to that which must be most essential to us in this life Jesus Christ present to us in the Most Holy Eucharist This is why we joyously await the day for when we as a parish family can all gather together again inperson at the altar of the Lord to worship our Lord in the Most Holy Eucharist In the words of St Thrse of Lisieux In the presence of Jesus in the Holy Sacrament we ought to be like the Blessed in heaven before the Divine Essence Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe Advent This weekend brings a close to our liturgical year as we celebrate the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe Our front cover of this bulletin is a biblical explanation of our stained glass window in the Church that represents this liturgical celebration Bringing an end to our liturgical year this yearly feast offers a joyous reminder to all Christians Jesus Christ is King In the words of Pope Pius XI when promulgating this feast day Once men recognize both in private and in public life that Christ is King society will at last receive the great blessings of real liberty wellordered discipline peace and harmony May we strive each and everyday to allow Jesus to be the King of our Heart and in doing so to reflect His Kingship in everything that we think say and do If we strive to do this we will begin to change the world one person at a time starting with us Ending the liturgical year means that next weekend we will begin a new year of Gods grace as we enter into Advent The season of Advent serves as a wonderful time to reevaluate our relationship with God and to refocus our lives upon Him The next four weekends are meant to prepare us to welcome the Incarnation of the Son of God Jesus Christ Throughout Advent we will have a variety of opportunities to grow in the Lord Available this weekend our Little Blue Books are in the narthex in both English and Spanish as well as a number of Advent Calendars Our Parish Mission will be offered from Monday Dec 7th through Wednesday Dec 9th at 7 PM each evening in the church led by Fr Stephen Felicichia The
