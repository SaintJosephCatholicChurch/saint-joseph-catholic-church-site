  "text": "WELFTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME UNE 20 2021 Happy Fathers Day to all of the fathers of our parish In this Year of St Joseph to whom was entrusted the care of Our Lord Jesus Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary we ask his intercession for all fathers today This includes fathers grandfathers godparents priests deacons uncles and all other men who often serve as fathers in important ways within extended family parish communities or individuals lives On this day may the example of St Joseph who quietly cared for Jesus and put the needs of the Holy Family before his own stand as a witness to the loving model of Christian fatherhood Know that you remain in all of our prayers as we ask the Lord through the intercession of St Joseph to give you wisdom fidelity joy and an outpouring of His strength and courage Your own witness of sacrificial love helps each of us grow deeper in our relationship with Jesus Christ Entering into the Twelfth Sunday of Ordinary Time the Church will remain in this season for twentytwo more weeks Throughout the past many liturgical seasons our bulletin cover has highlighted different aspects of each season Throughout Ordinary Time our covers will resume having a more catechetical nature highlighting different aspects of our Faith NNIVERSARY OF OUR HURCH EDICATION Next weekend we will have a special opportunity to celebrate our parish at all of our weekend Masses The Church invites each parish each year to celebrate the anniversary of the dedication of their churchbuilding If this anniversary falls during Ordinary Time we are even able to transfer this celebration to the nearest Sunday so that our whole parish family may join in this moment of giving thanks to God Our current churchbuilding was dedicated by Bishop Leo Pursley the sixth bishop of our diocese on June 26 1966 at the 10:30AM Sunday morning Mass He was joined by Fr Robert Traub thenpastor of our parish several visiting priests and numerous members of the Faithful According to all accounts those gathered endured sweltering temperatures to participate in the ceremony While we still hear the readings for the Thirteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time our proper prayers Entrance Antiphon opening Collect Preface Prayer over the Offerings Communion Antiphon and Prayer after Communion will seem slightly different Instead of being taken from the Thirteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time they will come from the Common of a Church on the Anniversary of its Dedication This liturgical celebration is of course not simply about a single building Instead it is about an event the dedication of the building Why is this event worthy of celebration Because this particular churchbuilding our church building represents an important moment in the life of the particular Church in Wells County In this way we celebrate the continued spread of the Gospel throughout Wells County We celebrate our continued union through the Bishop of our diocese with the Successor of St Peter We celebrate our own unity as a diocese through union with our Bishop Bishop Rhoades Most importantly we celebrate the dwelling of God with men reconciled and united in Christ Catechism of the
