parish's participation in the preparation for the upcoming Diocesan Synod called by Bishop Rhoades for November of 2026 Having spent the past two weeks in prayer we now invite the Holy Spirit to guide our participations our hearts and our voices This session is an opportunity for us to prayerfully reflect on one central question How is our local Church called to live the mission of Christ today and in the years to come This evening will allow each of us to share our voices prayerful reflections and experiences as a unique and irreplaceable part of our local Church Our parish session will in turn help guide the direction of the larger Diocesan Synod At the end of the Parish Listening Session the various insights shared will be compiled and submitted to Bishop Rhoades as a faithful representation of our parish's voice With our contributions and those of the other parishes of our diocese the Bishop will set the broader synodal questions that will be reflected upon at the Diocesan Synod this coming November Note Childcare will be provided for the Parish Listening Session on February 9th Blessing of Throats for the Feast of St Blaise On Tuesday Feb 3rd the Church celebrated the Memorial of St Blaise Bishop and Martyr Serving as the 4th Century bishop in Sebastia in modern day Turkey St Blaise was imprisoned during the persecutions of Licinius While being led to prison he saved a young boy choking on a fish bone In gratitude the boy's mother brought him candles to light his prison cell at night Refusing to renounce the Faith under torture St Blaise and beheaded Given these accounts of his life St Blaise is known as the patron saint of those with illnesses of the throat and the blessing of St Blaise is given with two candles blessing is a sacramental which invokes
