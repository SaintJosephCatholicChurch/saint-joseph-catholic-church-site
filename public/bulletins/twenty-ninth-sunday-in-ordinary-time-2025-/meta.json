Sunday in Ordinary Time October 19 2025 Infant and Pregnancy Loss Memorial Prayer Service The month of October is nationally observed as the annual month of Remembrance for Pregnancy and Infant Loss As part of this national commemoration for those affected by such terrible tragedies our parish will hold a prayer service this afternoon This Memorial Prayer Service will be this afternoon October 19th at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery at 2 PM This service is open to parishioners and all throughout Wells County The prayer service includes the opportunity to place memorial butterfly ornaments at the cemetery These memorial butterfly ornaments will be available at the prayer service but are also available throughout the coming week at our two local funeral homes in town Those who may not be ready to attend a public service are invited to go and privately and prayerfully place their own butterfly ornaments at the cemetery Memorial Prayer Service Sunday October 19th at 2 PM Address St Joseph Catholic Cemetery 2980 State Rd 124 Bluffton Solemnity of All Saints Nov 1st This year the Solemnity of All Saints falls on Saturday November 1st Falling on a Saturday the obligation for this holy day has been abrogated by our bishop This means that we are not obliged to assist at Mass for this solemnity Though not a holy day of obligation may we still see this day as a holy day of opportunity as we celebrate this feast in honor of the Church Triumphant the Saints in heaven To celebrate the Solemnity of All Saints we will offer two Masses on Saturday November 1st at 8:00AM and 11:00AM Following the 11:00AM Mass you are invited to join us in the Parish Social Hall for our annual All Saints Day Party Beginning with a luncheon and potluck in the Social Hall after the 11:00AM Mass we will move to games for our youth in the Parish Gymnasium You are invited to come dressed as your favorite Saint Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed Nov 2nd Following our celebration of the Church Triumphant we turn our prayers to the Church Suffering the Holy Souls in Purgatory As the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed falls on Sunday November 2nd it will replace the Thirty first Sunday in Ordinary Time The weekend Masses Saturday 5:00PM Sunday 7:30AM 10:00AM will use the prayers and readings proper to this commemoration as we pray for our dearly departed loved ones In addition to our normal weekend Mass schedule we will also offer an additional Sunday Mass on Sunday November 2nd at 1:00PM at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery As the Church encourages us to pray for the souls of the departed offering Mass at the cemetery is a powerful and public expression of our prayerful remembrance of those who have gone before us Missing Pews As you may have hopefully noticed two rows of pews are missing With contracts finally signed by the diocese we've given the go ahead to begin work on restoring our pews in anticipation for our greater renovation project Over the next several months rows will be removed repaired and returned two at a time For this part of our renovation project we are working with local Yaste Painting Inc to re stain and repair the pews as needed As this is the first major work on our pews in several decades we've found that they're in great overall condition given their age while still also in need of some major repair work In addition to any re staining needed we will be replacing the worn laminate footing at the base of each pew and working to ensure that each pew is securely bolted to the floor The connection between the floor bolt and the wood of the pew often weakens over the years Saturday October 18 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am Confession 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Janis Lindzy Sunday October 19 7:10am
