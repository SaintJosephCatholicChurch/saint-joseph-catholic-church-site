SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR July 29 2018 If you have ever wondered the Gospel readings we hear each Sunday at Mass are not simply chosen at random Instead the Church has formed a three year cycle from which the Sunday readings come This cycle is labeled as Year Year and Year In Year we read mostly from the Gospel of St Matthew In Year the Gospel of St Mark and Year the Gospel of St Luke The Gospel of St John not be forgotten is read primarily during the Easter Season in all three years of the cycle Through this cycle by our faithful attendance at Sunday Mass we will hear from the majority of the four Gospels new year in the cycle will always begin at the start of the liturgical year or the First Sunday in Advent This year we are currently in Year meaning we are hearing primarily from the Gospel of St Mark Starting this weekend however our Gospel readings from St Mark will be interrupted by readings from the 6th Chapter of the Gospel of St John often referred to as the Bread of Life discourse Over the next sev eral weekends we will hear Jesus very clear teachings regarding the Eucharist His Body and His Blood taken from St John This interruption is no accident but was intentionally included by the Church when the three year cycle was set We celebrate today the 17th Sunday in Ordinary Time There are a total of 34 Sundays in Ordinary Time This means that today we are truly in the middle of the liturgical year Not only then are we in the middle of the liturgical year but as we are in Year of our threeyear cycle of Scripture readings we are truly in the center of the whole threeyear cycle itself This means that in our proclamation of the Gospel the Church has placed our Lords teachings from John 6 on the Eucharist at its very center In the same way we as a Eucharistic people must make the Eucharist the very center of our lives If we were to continue from where we had left off last Sunday in the Gospel of St Mark we would now be hearing St Marks description of the Feeding of the Five Thousand Mark 63444 As this miracle however is the only miracle story ac counted in all four Gospels we find ourselves hearing St Johns telling of the miracle referred to as the Multiplication of the Loaves John 6115 In our first reading from 2 Kings we hear of a similar miracle though on a much smaller scale performed by the prophet Elisha This passage of the Old Testament would have been forefront on the minds of the large crowd present when our Lord multiplied the loaves For this reason the crowd calls our Lord the Prophet and hav ing fulfilled their physical needs wish to crown Him as their king They wished to make Jesus the center of their worldly life but He instead withdraws Himself Jesus does not wish to simply to be our worldly king but instead our Savior To fill not simply our worldly hungers but the deepest longings of our hearts To truly become the very center of our lives As St Paul describes in our second reading we put on the new self when we encounter our Lord In meeting Jesus our very lives are changed We can no longer continue in our selfish ways but in meeting Jesus are turned outward And we meet Him in a very intimate way each and every time we receive Him in the Eucharist How will we allow this encounter to change us How will we allow Jesus to become the very center of our lives In Christ Fr David SCRIPTUREMASS
