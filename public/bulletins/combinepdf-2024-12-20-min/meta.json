their winter break and all military personnel on leave with us this coming Christmastide This weekend December 21st 22nd the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday of Advent Our readings mark a switch in focus from St John the Baptist to the events immediately leading up to the birth of Jesus Christ With today's Gospel we join the Blessed Mother and St Elizabeth in the joyous and expectant excitement that arises from the coming of Jesus With them we already rejoice to welcome our Savior before we see even Him directly As these last few days of Advent quickly pass us by may we prepare to warmly welcome all those who will be joining us for the coming holy days If you know of any who have been away from the practice of the Faith or even just Church itself please reach out to them and personally invite them to join in our Christmas celebrations May they find in us such joy that they will be drawn irresistibly to come back and be with us each Sunday Book Study Great Catholic Thinkers In September we began a walk through of The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri Over several sessions we worked our way through the entirety of The Inferno which was no small task Moving into the winter months we will be offering a new opportunity for a parish book study Instead of diving into a single work we will instead turn our focus on a number of short stories and poems from various Catholic authors throughout history This approach will allow us to explore a truly rich tapestry of themes from the struggles of Faith and the nature of grace to the exploration of human virtue and sin There is truly an enormous treasure trove of literature available to us that can offer unique perspectives and provide enriching experiences for all participating in these sessions whether they are well versed in Catholic literature or just beginning to explore it Our first session will be on Monday January 13th at 6:30PM in the Parish Conference Room Each session will include time for discussion and reflection on how the story of the day speaks to our modern lives I encourage and invite you to join us for this enriching journey through Catholic literature as we discover how these timeless works continue to inspire and shape our understanding of the world and our relationship with God Please see the sign up sheet in the Narthex to receive more information about this upcoming opportunity Advent Baby Shower Thank you for supporting our Advent Baby Shower to benefit one of our local pregnancy and family resource centers Helping Hands and the families they serve Donations can be placed in the playpen in the Narthex throughout the end of this weekend In the words of Pope St Leo the Great Let us prepare for Christ's coming and make ourselves ready to welcome Him by giving to those in need that we may reflect His light in the world Christmas at the Diocesan Museum One of the hidden gems of our diocese is the Diocesan Museum alongside the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Fort Wayne If you're looking for something fun to do throughout this Christmastide I encourage you to go and visit the museum Throughout Christmastide the museum has a display of over 130 Nativity Scenes from all throughout the world Admittance to the Museum is free It is located in Fort Wayne next to the Cathedral on 1103 Calhoun Street It is open Tuesdays thru Saturdays from 10:00AM to 2:00PM Free parking is available in the Cathedral Parking Lot During my summers as a seminarian I had the great opportunity to assist in the upkeep of the Diocesan Museum It contains a great wealth of knowledge about our Catholic history in the area I hope you have a chance to visit ORG Our Parish Code 7N68MY Weekend of December 28th 29th 500 Teresa Smith 730 David Smith 1000 Jay
