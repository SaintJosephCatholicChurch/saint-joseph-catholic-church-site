  "text": "Fifth Sunday of Lent April 3 2022 This weekend April 2nd 3rd the Church enters the Fifth Sunday of Lent which also has been referred to as Passiontide This Sunday serves as a period of quiet between Laetare Sunday and Palm Sunday It is our last opportunity to meditate on the ordinary struggle of Lent before we enter into the intensity of Holy Week and the Sacred Paschal Triduum To signal the intensity of what is to come we veil the crosses and sacred images in the church this weekend As we turn our focus entirely on the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ we now even visually fast from beauty itself At the same time the veil over the Cross in an ironic manner draws our attention even more greatly towards it and the great price that was paid for our salvation Though we are preparing to enter this solemn time we have a reason to celebrate with great joy at the end of this week On Friday April 8th we welcome Bishop Rhoades to St Joseph's as he celebrates the ritual Mass of Confirmation for our 7 Confirmandi and those Confirmandi joining us from St Joseph Hessen Cassel In the past we paired with St Mary's in Decatur for Confirmation Moving forward we will now serve as the Confirmation host parish for our own parish St Joseph Hessen Cassel and St Aloysius Palm Sunday Procession Next weekend Palm Sunday enters us into Holy Week At each weekend Mass we will have the distribution and blessing of palms At our 10 AM Sunday Mass you are invited to join us for our annual Palm Sunday Procession At this Mass our Choir will help lead us into the Church as we carry palm branches to commemorate Jesus joyous and messianic entry into Jerusalem The Palm Sunday Procession will begin at 10 AM on Sunday April 10th in the parking lot outside of the Parish Office Parish Liturgical Updates Thank you to those who offered their thoughts after Masses last weekend regarding our remaining pews that offer physical distancing Taking into account the responses received we will be removing the ropes on the Marian side north side of the Church starting next weekend This should help alleviate overcrowding at Masses especially as we've seen an increase in those joining us on weekends For those still desiring physical distancing we will continue to reserve the first several pews on the St Joseph side south side of the Church at this time Of our remaining prudential practices Bishop Rhoades has informed the priests of the diocese that the suspension of the distribution of the Most Precious Blood as suggested both by various health agencies and the Vatican will continue for the foreseeable future While reception under both species has a significant sign value we do know as a truth of faith that we receive Christ fully Body Blood Soul and Divinity when we receive Him under either species This is known as the doctrine of concomitance Did You Know Confession Forgives Sin The Sacrament of Confession is one of the most unique and beautiful aspects of Catholicism Jesus Christ in His abundant love and mercy established the Sacrament of Confession John 2021 23 so that we as sinners can obtain forgiveness for our sins and reconcile with God and the Church This sacrament washes us clean and renews us in Christ If you haven't been to Confession in a while the Catholic Church wants to welcome you back and invite you to participate in this beautiful sacrament of healing at our Penance Service on Tuesday April 5th at 7 PM You'll be surprised about how free you feel after taking part in the Sacrament of Confession Jesus is calling you to experience His mercy in this way too Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday April 2 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am Confession 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Parish Family Sunday
