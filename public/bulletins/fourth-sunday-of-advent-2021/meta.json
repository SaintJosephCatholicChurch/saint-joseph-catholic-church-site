  "text": "OURTH UNDAY OF DVENT ECEMBER 19 2021 special Welcome Home to all of our university students and servicemen and women who are home for the holiday We look forward to rejoicing together in the Nativity of our Lord Jesus on Christmas Day This weekend December 18th 19th the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday of Advent Our focus is now shifting from the first to the second half of the Advent season from preparing for the second coming of Christ the Parousia to rejoicing in the Incarnation itself Though the time for our rejoicing is near it is not yet here As seen in todays Gospel Luke 139 45 we join in Our Ladys pregnant expectation to welcome the Savior We still have several days of preparation ahead This time is not only for trimming the hearth and setting the table for Christmas but preparing our hearts for Christ As part of this preparation as a parish family we will have our Advent Parish Mission offered every evening at 7 PM this Monday through Wednesday Each evening will also be livestreamed for those who cannot be with us in person We will welcome a different speaker each evening to help us as we continue to prepare for Christmas Day In addition to our Parish Mission we will also have our Advent Penance Service this Tuesday evening 730 with individual reconciliation offered following the 7:00PM Parish Mission that evening Fr Daniel Koehl our mission speaker for the evening Fr Bill Sullivan and myself will be available for Confessions as long as needed We will also still have our regular weekly times for confession offered throughout the week on Tuesday morning 830900 AM Wednesday evening 600645 PM Saturday afternoon 400445 PM or by appointment HRISTMAS ASS IMES We are planning and preparing to welcome not only our parish family for our Christmas liturgies but also a number of visitors and guests With our additional Mass times for Christmas we hope to alleviate any overcrowding in the Church itself If you see an individual that you may not recognize please welcome them to the parish May every guest joining us find in us such joy that they will be drawn irresistibly to come back and be with us each Sunday Each of our Christmas liturgies will have a unique feature and will be live streamed Our 4:00PM Christmas Eve Vigil Mass will have the blessing of our Nativity Scene Our 6:00PM Christmas Eve Vigil Mass will have music led by both our Choir and our new Childrens Choir Prior to the 6:00PM Mass join our Choir at 5:30PM in the Church to join in the singing of Christmas carols Our Midnight Christmas Mass will be offered by candlelight Our 9:00AM Christmas Day Mass will welcome Fr Bill Sullivan as celebrant As a reminder we do have the obligation and opportunity to join together in worship twice this coming weekend both for our yearly Christmas obligation and for our normal Sunday obligation The Mass Planning Guide on the front of this bulletin can help guide your decision on which two Mass times you will be planning to attend and participate in for Christmas and the Feast of the Holy Family If you are travelling for the holiday know of our prayers for your safe travels for a joyous visit wherever you may be headed and that we look forward to your return so that we may gather together again as one parish family in worship of the Lord MASS INTENTIONS Saturday December 18 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm
