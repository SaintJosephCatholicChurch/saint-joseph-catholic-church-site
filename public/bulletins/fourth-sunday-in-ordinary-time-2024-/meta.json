the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time In today's Gospel we hear of how Jesus preaches with authority This authoritative preaching continues even today as our Lord continues to preach to us today in His Church His Body here on earth Truly the Church is an extension of Jesus into the world Our bulletin cover offers some insight into the means by which this authoritative preaching continues This coming Friday February 2nd will mark forty days since Christmas Day On this day the Church celebrates the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord when our Lord would have been presented in the Temple by our Blessed Mother and St Joseph in accordance with the Law of Moses High lighting the words of Simeon who recognizes Jesus as a light to the nations this feast is also often known as Candlemas We are also now just two and a half weeks away from Ash Wednesday and the beginning of the Lenten season For your planning purposes we will offer Masses on Ash Wednesday February 14th at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM With this beautiful penitential season so near now is a good time to start preparing for it I would encourage you to use these coming few weeks as an opportunity to prayerfully discern how you might approach this season Traditionally Lent is a time where we focus in a more deliberate way on the practices of Prayer Fasting and Almsgiving Incorporating these three pillars of the spiritual life into our own lives will aid us in deepening our relationship with the Lord Each of these three call us to a deeper conversion as we strive to give our entire lives over to the Lord Let us begin thinking now how we will incorporate these practices into our lives this Lenten season Feast of St Blaise and the Blessing of Throats St Blaise served as the fourth century Bishop in Sebastia known today as Silva in modern day Turkey Trained as a doctor he served the people of his city faithfully in this vocation for a number of years After the death of the local bishop St Blaise with overwhelming requests from the local faithful was appointed to succeed him After his ordination and during the persecutions initiated under the Emperor Licinius St Blaise was imprisoned As he was being led to prison St Blaise was permitted to stop and save a nearby boy choking on a fish bone Later that day the boy's mother filled with gratitude brought candles to St Blaise to light his cell at night Refusing to renounce the Faith under torture he was beheaded shortly after Given these accounts St Blaise is known as the patron of those with illnesses of the throat and the blessing of St Blaise is given with two candles In honor of the Feast of St Blaise we will offer our annual Blessing of Throats after all Masses this coming weekend February 3rd 4th Flocknote Sign up

1985 with parishioners sponsoring children through scholarships to provide tuition uniforms school supplies and more so they may receive an education at Santa Maria Mazzarello School in Bolivia

give back to the poor communities they grew up in The school year in Bolivia begins February 1st and concludes in October Scholarships are still 90 10month for 9 months per child plus an optional Christmas donation You may pay by the month for the year or anywhere in between If you are interested in sponsoring a child please call the Parish Office at <a
