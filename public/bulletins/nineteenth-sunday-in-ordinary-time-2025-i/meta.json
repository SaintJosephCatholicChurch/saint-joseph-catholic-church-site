celebrates the Nineteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Though we are just over the halfway point of this liturgical season our readings this weekend make it seem that we are near the end It is often only in November as Ordinary Time draws to a close when we begin to hear readings so seemingly focused on the coming of the Son of Man that day and hour which no one knows when the world will be judged Though our readings seem a bit apocalyptic their meaning is fairly clear Always be prepared The Christian life is one meant to be lived in vigilance not just at the end but all the way through This means that in our daily lives we are called to live with our hearts ready to encounter the Lord Whether Jesus comes at an unexpected hour or simply meets us in those around us our task is the same To live each day always ready to welcome Him Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Holy Day of Obligation On Friday the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary This day celebrates our belief that the Blessed Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory As this solemnity is a Holy Day of Obligation we are offering several Mass times to assist in meeting this obligation Mass Times for the Solemnity of the Assumption Holy Day of Obligation Vigil Mass on Thursday August 14th at 7 PM Mass on Friday August 15th at 7 AM Noon and 5:30PM Though the dogma of the Assumption was only formally declared by Pope Pius XII seventy five years ago the roots of the teaching itself can be traced back to early centuries of the Church By the fourth century a church had been built to mark the ancient and empty Tomb of Mary at the foot of the Mount of Olives feast day celebrating this mystery was introduced in the East by the fifth century and spread to the West by the sixth and seventh century The testimony of the early Church preserved in our liturgical celebration and theological reflection underscores how deeply belief in Mary's bodily Assumption was woven into the Church's life and faith Long before it was formally defined this truth lived in the Church's memory and imagination passed down throughout the centuries It was a belief universally honored in preaching hymnody and devotional practice This belief finds itself in seed form in Scripture and over the centuries blossomed into the dogma as professed today In the Old Testament we find two accounts of individuals being taken assumed into heaven In Genesis 522 24 Enoch a descendant of Seth is described as one who walked with God before he was taken up to heaven Likewise in 2 Kings 211 the prophet Elijah is taken up to heaven in a fiery chariot a dramatic sign of God's favor In the New Testament the Angel Gabriel greets Mary as full of grace Luke 128 literally you who have been and always remain filled with grace in the Greek This declaration forms the scriptural foundation for the dogma of the Immaculate Conception while also pointing forward to the Assumption As St Paul teaches the wages of sin is death Romans 623 therefore if Mary is preserved from all stain of sin it follows that she would also be preserved from its consequence Death In this way the Assumption is the natural result of Mary's being full of grace Because she is full of grace her body too shares fully now in the redemption won by Christ At the end of her earthly life it was only fitting that God would preserve her from bodily corruption and take her body soul into heavenly glory She who bore Christ in her womb and stood faithfully at the foot of the Cross does not suffer the corruption of the grave but instead shares immediately and completely in the victory of her Son's resurrection Saturday August 9 8:00am Special Intention 830
