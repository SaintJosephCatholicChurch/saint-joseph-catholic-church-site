celebrates the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord This day marks the fortieth day since Christmas and traditionally marked the end of Christmastide though the season now ends earlier with the latest reform of the liturgical calendar in 1969 On this day the Blessed Mother and St Joseph would have presented Jesus in the Temple in fulfillment of the Mosaic Law cf Leviticus 121 8 Exodus 132 According to the Law the Holy Family would have offered a sacrifice at the Temple as a ritual sign of purification for a mother on the fortieth day after the birth of a child The Christ child likewise would be consecrated to God as the family's firstborn son The sacrifice to be offered was that of a lamb and a turtle dove unless the family could not afford a lamb for sacrifice Then a second turtle dove was to be offered in place of the lamb As we know from the Gospel reading today the Holy Family could not afford a lamb for sacrifice and instead offered two turtle doves Yet though they knew it not they had brought with them the true Lamb whose sacrifice would take away the sin of the world cf John 129 Carried in the arms of Mary the living Ark of the Covenant herself Jesus is brought into the Temple various prophecies are fulfilled and the whole law is satisfied Blessing of Throats for the Feast of St Blaise Among the candles blessed at the beginning of today's Mass were the candles that are used as a part of the Blessing of Throats in commemoration of the Feast of St Blaise As his feast day is tomorrow Monday Feb 3rd we are offering this special blessing after all Masses this weekend As reflected in the life of St Blaise on our bulletin cover St Blaise is the patron saint of all those suffering with illnesses of the throat blessing is a sacramental which invokes Gods power and care upon those blessed They are meant to awaken us to the presence of God and dispose us to receiving Gods grace in our lives As such all people of good will Catholic and non Catholic alike are welcome to come forward for this special blessing and with St Blaise ask God to sanctify our lives and protect us from all harm First Friday Adoration Time Change Due to our Forty Hours Devotion in December and the holy days in November and January it's been several months since we've had the chance to offer First Friday Adoration Thankfully with a return to normalcy in Ordinary Time we will be able to once again resume this wonderful devotion for First Fridays throughout the rest of the year Please note however a slight change to our ending time for First Friday Adoration Previously First Friday Adoration went until 6 PM and concluded with benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and an additional evening Mass Since last May however it's clear that the last two evening hours 4 PM 6 PM are difficult times for people to regularly gather for adoration As such our First Friday Adoration will now go from 9 AM to 4 PM with Confessions offered from 3 PM to 3:45PM and concluding benediction starting at 3:45PM 150th Anniversary Parish Cookbook As a part of our 150th Anniversary celebration we are starting work on a new parish cookbook As our last parish cookbook was compiled in 2000 this anniversary year seems the perfect time to compile an updated version If you would like to submit a recipe for the cookbook you can do so either by filling out the form available in the narthex and returning it to the Parish Office or by filling out the online form available on the parish website Recipes will be collected starting this weekend through Sunday March 16th On the recipe forms there is also a section for Special Comments Story Notes If your recipe has an interesting history has been passed down throughout your family or is a favorite for a special time of year make sure to include that information here so that it can be shared in the cookbook In Christ Fr David Weekend of February 8th 9th 500 Dan Lautzenheiser 730 Donna Geisel 1000 David Smith 500 Knights of Columbus
