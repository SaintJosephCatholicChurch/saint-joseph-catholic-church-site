  "text": "HE OST OLY RINITY AY 30 2021 This weekend May 29th30th the Church celebrates Trinity Sunday The liturgical celebration itself is traced back to the 12th 13th Centuries Its roots however go back much further to the 4th Century At the Council of Niceae in 325 AD the Church responding to the Arian heresys denial of Jesus Divinity defined Jesus Divine Sonship From this Church council we received the Nicene Creed the same Creed that the Church has professed for 1700 years and that we continue to profess together every Sunday EMORIAL AY ASS ONDAY AY 31ST AT 9 On Memorial Day we commemorate the men and women who have laid down their lives in service to our nation for the sake of freedom and peace We recognize not only their heroic sacrifice but the sacrifice shared by their family and friends who mourn their loss We invite you to begin Memorial Day in pray as we gather for the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass at 9:00am IFTING OF THE ISPENSATION AND PDATED ITURGICAL UIDELINES On Friday June 11th the bishops of our state including Bishop Rhoades are lifting the general dispensation from the obligation to attend Mass on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation This means that except for those with serious health risks and caregivers of those with health risks Catholics are obliged to return to inperson Mass on the weekend of June 12th 13th In addition to this announcement Bishop Rhoades after consultation with local health experts and following CDC guidance has updated our diocesan liturgical guidelines Under these new guidelines parishes are able to loosen social distancing requirements and the use of face masks within the church building is now optional At our parish we will continue to offer several rows of pews that maintain social distancing and face masks will continue to be available in the narthex for those who choose to make use of them TEVE OLCHIN ETIREMENT Fr Steve Colchin pastor of St Mary Catholic Church in Huntington is retiring this coming June as he nears his 75th birthday Through his 37 years of active ministry Fr Steve has served at several parishes throughout our diocese including our own St Joseph was Fr Steves first pastorate where he faithfully served our parish family from 19911997 To express our parishs gratitude to and prayers for Fr Steve there are several retirement cards available to be signed in the narthex both this and next weekend What does a priest do when he retires In retirement a priest retires from the administrative duties of running a parish and serving as a pastor Even when retired a priest remains a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek Ps 1104 and will continue to offer the Sacraments In his retirement Fr Steve will be retiring to his family home in nearby Decatur and assisting in the sacramental life of surrounding parishes as needed AILY ASS CHEDULE IN JUNE Due to my summer class schedule through the Catholic University of America CUA we will need to make changes to our daily
