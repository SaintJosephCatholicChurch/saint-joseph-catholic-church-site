LORD SO THAT YOU WILL BE OPPORTUNED TO SEE THE SALVATION OF OUR GOD My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all Advent Penance Service ConfessionReconciliation is tomorrow Monday December 11 2017 at 7:00pm here in this our Church St Josephs Please tell others come you your self and encourage others to come So get ready for it As we await the new heaven and the new earth let us make clear the way of the Lord by being servants of justice truth peace forgiveness and love Today one week has passed since Advent began I hope that you are preparing the way for the Lord God The way Is your way of life The way you do thing Striving to do good always And surely you are listening to the voice of one crying in the wilderness Prepares the way of the Lord make straight his parts That is the parts of our God Keep ing His Commandments Thus in the first Reading Is 4015 911 Prophet Isaiah in a beautiful poetic lan guage was telling the Israelites to wait for Gods deliverance from their trouble in Babylon where they were serving as slaves in exile under terrible conditions You know waiting can sometimes be devastating when we are not sure of the outcome of our waiting Take as an example someone waiting to be called in by a doctor to tell himher the result of the XRay Will the result be good or bad the patient asks himself herself Will it be tumor Is it malignant Or someone waiting for the result of an inter view for a job one desperately needed We can find ourselves in such a situation Through the prophet God is telling us that he will step in and lead us out of such hope lessness situation He will take care of our needs if we place our trust in him Here comes our God Whatever your problems whatever fault sins committed you can still have a happy Christmas and celebrate the Emmanuel God is with us Let the respon sorial Psalm Ps 85 be your prayer and consolation today Lord let us see your kind ness and grant us your salvation In the 2nd reading 2Pt 3814 we are reminded that Gods time is the best His ways are not ours While we wait for his coming in judgment we must be ready vigilant without fault or spot or blemish Strive for it is possible In the Gospel Mk 118 the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled historically and liter ally when John the Baptist preached the saving Advent of God in the wilderness by the Jordan River where the salvation of God was in fact seen There Christs glory was made known to all when after he was baptized The heavens were opened and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove and rested upon him Then the fathers voice was heard in testimony to Jesus his son This is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased John the Baptist humbly testified that he was not worthy to untie the thongs of his shoes I hope that everybody is preparing for the Lord How do we pre pare Confess your sins forgive those who offended you ask for forgiveness to those you offended including yourself Love care for the unloved and the abandoned those forgotten help the poor and the needy make peace God bless you Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 We plan for Pilgrimage to the Holy Land to join in the Foot Steps of
