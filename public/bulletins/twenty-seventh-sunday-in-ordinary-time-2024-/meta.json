Since 1998 the Sunday closest to October 15th has been nationally observed as the annual Day for Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance In observance of this day we will hold a prayer service to remember and support those affected by pregnancy and infant loss This Memorial Prayer Service will be on Sunday October 13th at St Joseph Catholic Cemetery at 2 PM This service is open to parishioners and all throughout Wells County The prayer service includes the opportunity to place memorial butterfly ornaments at the cemetery These memorial butterfly ornaments will be available in the narthex at both of our local funeral homes throughout this coming week and at the cemetery the day of the prayer service Those who may not be ready to attend a public service are invited to take and place their own butterfly ornaments at the cemetery privately Memorial Prayer Service Sunday October 15th at 2 PM Address St Joseph Catholic Cemetery 2980 State Rd 124 Bluffton Ask Father Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship With our national and local election cycles in full swing we will be offering a special Ask Father on Tuesday October 22nd at 6:30PM in the Parish Conference Room During this session we will review our national Bishops Conference teaching document on the political responsibility of Catholics Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship This document is available for review on our parish website The Liturgy of the Word The Liturgy of the Word consists of three readings and a psalm The First Reading comes from the Old Testament except during Eastertide when we hear from the Acts of the Apostles The Responsorial Psalm is taken from the Psalms or one of the scriptural canticles The Second Reading from the letters of the New Testament except during Eastertide when we hear from the Book of Revelation Finally the Gospel always comes from one of the four Gospels The First Reading is usually chosen based on its connection with the Gospel This arrangement highlights the unity of the Old and New Testaments and the history of salvation with Christ always at its center The Responsorial Psalm is chosen in close relation to the First Reading and is meant to foster a deeper meditation on Sacred Scripture The psalm draws out our reflection on God's salvific nature and deeds The Second Reading unlike the first is generally not intentionally aligned with the Gospel or any other reading Instead it offers examples of practical applications of how a life in Christ can be lived Though written centuries ago these readings are still fundamentally relevant for us today The Gospel serves as our primary encounter in the Liturgy of the Word with the life of Jesus who is the Word made flesh As such the Gospel is a saving message that is meant to be life changing Though seated throughout most of the Liturgy of the Word at the Gospel we stand in reverence and sing Alleluia a Hebrew expression of joy that means Praise the Lord The priest carries the Book of the Gospels slightly elevated from the altar to the lectern accompanied by altar servers carrying candles This procession underscores the solemnity of the Gospel In preparation to hear the Gospel we make a significant three fold sign of the cross on our forehead our lips and over our heart Accordingly we prayerfully ask for the Gospel to penetrate the whole of our being influencing us totally and taking firm root in our mind and heart such that we may always profess these saving words with our mouth Faithfully in Christ Fr David Weekend of October 12th and 13th 500 Dan Lautzenheiser 730 David Smith
