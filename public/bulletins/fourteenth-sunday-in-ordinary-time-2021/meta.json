  "text": "OURTEENTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME ULY 4 2021 Happy Independence Day I hope the holiday is a great time of rest and blessings for you and your families As we celebrate the freedoms which we have may we always remember to give thanks to God for them and to pray for all those who have given their lives for the sake of our freedom We welcome Fr Jose Panamattathil VC as our diocesan mission speaker and celebrant this weekend special Thank You to Fr Jose for sharing with us the good work that his religious order the Vincentians is perform ing in North India and Africa And Thank You also to all of you for your generous spiritual and financial support of this missionary effort If you did not have the opportunity to make a donation to Fr Joses congregation this weekend but still would like to do so please write Mission Collection on any donations next weekend In the desire for full financial transparency please note that in our diocese ninety percent of all mission collections go directly to the missions The remaining ten percent is retained by our diocese to cover the administrative costs for organizing the yearly mission collections in all parishes throughout the diocese special Thank You to locally owned Above All Roofing for re roofing the rectory Working with our insurance company it was determined that the rectory roof was in need of replacement The new roof will ensure the upkeep of the rectory for decades to come This is only one of several projects that has been ongoing throughout our parish campus this summer Among these various projects a wall has been added in the Youth Den to separate it from a storage area used to hold cleaning supplies In the Parish Social Hall the disabled water fountain by the kitchen was removed In the newly empty niche this created a statue of St Joseph was enshrined Throughout July we are planning several painting projects including the Parish Social Hall the hallways of the EJ Schaefer Parish Center and the Religious Education Classrooms In the rectory I am working to update the kitchen which is fairly outdated I am also hoping to update the flooring and put a fresh coat of paint in several rooms as many encouraged me to do so after the Open House in October of 2019 As a reminder next weekend July 10th11th is the last weekend for our 12:30PM Sunday Mass This Mass added in May of 2020 was added in response to our diocesan liturgical directives for the return to public liturgies The additional Mass time helped to ensure that no single weekend Mass time would be overcrowded and allowed for greater physical distancing in the churchbuilding With the lifting of the general dispensation this past month we have safely been back in physical attendance at Mass for over 14 months At this time it seems prudent to invite all parishioners back to their normal Mass times and discontinue this additional time We will continue for the time being to keep several pews roped off allowing for the option of greater physical distancing in the churchbuilding If you may know of anyone who is still hesitant to return to public Mass Id encourage you to invite them to join us personal invitation goes a long way If they are not yet ready to join us on weekends invite them to join us during the weekday Our daily Masses are often more intimate with smaller numbers and allows for greater physical distancing in the churchbuilding Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday July 3 8:00am Special Intention 400445 pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Phyllis Makowski Sunday July 4
