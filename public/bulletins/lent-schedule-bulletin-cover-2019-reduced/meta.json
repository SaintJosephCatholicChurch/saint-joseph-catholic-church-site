today come from the 8th Sunday in Ordinary Time their call for selfreflection and conversion are perfectly placed in our liturgical year These penitential themes will help us in transitioning from Ordinary Time to the most sacred Lenten season this Wednesday March 6 when we mark the begin ning of Lent with Ash Wednesday The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass will be cele brated on Ash Wednesday at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM Note Incense will be used at the 7 PM Mass on Ash Wednesday Please see the front of the bulletin for a detailed schedule of our various parish devotions and offerings throughout Lent As we enter into the Lenten season please remember that Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are to be kept as days of prayer and fasting On these two days we not only abstain from meat but limit ourselves to one normal and two small meals throughout the day Throughout the remainder of Lent we also ab stain from meat on all Fridays These biblical practices of fasting Matthew 914 15 and abstinence Daniel 1023 both serve to strengthen our selfdisciple and stand as constant reminders that we live not for the comforts of this world but for the glory of God in the world to come The practice of fasting during Lent goes together with both prayer and almsgiving in preparing us for the Paschal Mystery These three practices have historically served as the pillars of spiritual growth throughout the Lenten season Fasting as mentioned above serves as our weapon against the flesh as it allows us to develop a mastery over our bodily desires and allow the love of God to be that which we truly desire at all times Romans 813 In addition to the observed days of fasting and abstinence I would encourage each of us to practice some form of daily fasting throughout these forty days This could be abstaining from a favored food or beverage dedicating time each day to fast from electronics or committing ourselves to redouble our efforts to remove some form of temptation or sin that we suffer from in our lives Prayer serves as our weapon against the devil as it keeps us in a contin ual conversation with the Lord The entirety of the Lenten season leading us into the most Sacred Triduum is dedicated to prayer We see this dedication exempli fied within our liturgies themselves as they are marked by austerity and simplicity throughout Lent Fewer flowers if any will adorn the church the Gloria is not sung at Mass the Alleluia before the Gospel is omitted the altar cross from our original Church will be placed upon the altar and starting on the Fifth Sunday of Lent Passiontide our statues and images will be veiled The austerity and simplicity during these forty days calls us to focus more intentionally and deeply on our rela tionship with the Lord To strengthen this focus we can make use of the many prayerful opportunities offered by the parish These opportunities for spiritual growth can take on a communal form such as attending Stations of the Cross every Friday or an additional weekday Mass each week andor a private form such as setting apart time on a daily basis for silence with and contemplation of the Sacred Scriptures or praying a Rosary every day Finally almsgiving serves as our weapon against the world as it reminds us that we do not live for ourselves or this world Romans 1478 In freely giving of our time talent and treasure to those in need we die towards our own self centeredness and enter into a deeper relationship with both our neighbor and God Hebrews 1316 Through almsgiving we find ourselves freely returning to God those things that He Himself has given us as we strive for the heavenly Jerusalem Almsgiving can be practiced through a monetary donation to a charity separate from our weekly tithe such as to our St Vincent de Paul Fund or our Lenten Canned Food Collection andor in service to others through the giving of our time and talent such as visiting nursing home residents or those who are homebound andor volunteering at a local charity In our prayer we should ask that the Lord to help us discern how we can best serve others through that which He has given us and when such an opportunity presents itself to have the courage to respond These forty days of Lent always pass much too quickly If approached with openness of heart and in response to Jesus call to conversion these days can change our lives Let us discern how we can best approach these days to be the most fruitful of days Days filled with prayer fasting and almsgiving May we all have a very blessed and very challenging Lent In Christ Fr David WEEKEND
