  "text": "WENTY EVENTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME October 4 2020 This weekend Oct 3rd4th the Church enters into the 27th Sunday in Ordinary Time This means that we have only 7 more weekends until the end of our liturgical year which ends on November 22nd with the celebration of the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ King of the Universe The end of the liturgical year will bring us into a new year of Gods grace beginning with the Season of Advent Until then however we remain drawing ever closer to the end of the liturgical year And as a reflection of this theme of the end of the year our readings over these next many weeks continue to have a focus on the end of the world itself Just as the liturgical year begins with Advent as we prepare for Christmas and celebrate the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ so it always ends celebrating Jesus as King of the Universe Our blessed Lord is the Alpha and the Omega the first and the last the beginning and the end Revelation 2213 And just as we prepare for the entrance of Jesus into this world so must we also prepare for our own entrance please God into the heavenly Kingdom This focus on the end times then is meant to help us focus on our own lives and what is truly important to us Jesus Christ offers us the Kingdom But He will not force us to enter it The gates of paradise have been opened by the sacrifice of our blessed Lord upon the Holy Cross but we still must choose to enter through those gates And truly the choice is ours God provides us the gift of His grace but He respects our free will to choose if and how to use His grace in our lives As we hear in our Gospel Matthew 213343 this weekend the choice vineyard has been cultivated and prepared It is now entrusted to the tenant farmers whom the landowner trusts completely The tenant farmers however turn against the landowner and reject all that he has done for them They forget that they are tenants and become selfcentered wishing to keep the fruit of the fields only for themselves Because of this selfishness they lose everything Our blessed Lord has entrusted the world and the mission of the Church to our care We are called not only to produce fruit but to share that fruit with the world We can never grow complacent in this mission or seek to hold the fruit for ourselves Instead we must share it with the world For the fruit that comes forth from the Lords vineyard is love and love can never be contained As Pope St John Paul II says when speaking of love With love there is no place for selfishnessand no place for fear Do not be afraid then when love makes demands Do not be afraid when love requires sacrifice The vineyard of the Lord has been prepared The ground is ripe to produce fruit And as we hear in the Gospel of St John I chose you from the world to go out and bear fruit fruit that will last John 1516 How will we respond to the Lords call Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults Our informational session for RCIA had a wonderful turnout
