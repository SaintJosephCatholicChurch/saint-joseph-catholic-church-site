<p>It is that time of year again to register your child(ren) for Religious Education Classes at St. Joseph&rsquo;s. Last year was a very trying time for the catechists and students, but with everyone&rsquo;s cooperation, we made it through with flying colors!</p>
<p>As of today, we have not received any guidelines from the Diocese, so we will begin classes with no specific restrictions. We will, however, continue to have hand sanitizer available in every classroom; masks are optional.</p>
<p>We are planning to have a <strong>Religious Education Registration Pizza &amp; Sundae Bar following 5:00 PM Mass on Saturday, August 28, in the Parish Social Hall</strong>. You may register your child(ren) and meet their catechist. You may pick up your Family Registration Packet that evening or, if you are unable to come on the 28th, please call the Parish Office (<a href="tel:(260) 824-1380">(260) 824-1380</a>) and make arrangements to pick up your packet.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Education Classes will begin on Sunday, September 12, 2021, from 8:30-9:45 a.m</strong>. If your child did not come to Religious Education Classes last year, please contact the Parish Office, as special arrangements or additional classes may need to be scheduled to help catch them up from last year.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions or concerns. The Parish Office is open Monday through Friday- 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.</p>
