Ordinary Time January 14 2024 This weekend January 13th 14th the Church celebrates the Second Sunday in Ordinary Time If you're wondering where the First Sunday in Ordinary Time went it has already silently passed right by us As the Christmas season ends with the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord the First Sunday in Ordinary Time is never actually celebrated Instead we enter into the First Week in Ordinary Time through our weekday Masses Prior to the revisions of the liturgical calendar in the mid twentieth century Epiphany like Christmas Day was celebrated as an octave The weeks after this octave and before Lent were then known as the Weeks after Epiphany and Septuagesima This latter name means seventy and falls seventy days before Easter Similar to today this time of the liturgical year was seen as a time of preparation for Lent Today we refer to this time as Ordinary Time though there is nothing ordinary about it The term Ordinary Time itself comes from the ordinal numbering of the following weeks Quite literally this term means that the first week of Ordinary Time is called the First Week of Ordinary Time the second week is the Second Week of Ordinary Time all the way through the very last week which is the Thirty fourth Week of Ordinary Time Thus the numbered weeks of Ordinary Time simply represent the ordered and everyday life of the Church outside of Her major feasts and solemnities When we are in Ordinary Time it is a time when we live our lives neither feasting as we do in the Christmas and Easter seasons or undertaking more severe penances as in Advent and Lent Instead it is a call to live our lives in the ordinary and everyday watchfulness of every Christian who is awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ In this way this season is ordinary only in that it helps to express the everyday of our lives When living for Jesus even the everyday is no longer meant to be simply ordinary Instead when we live in and through Him even the everyday and the ordinary is meant to become extraordinary This truly is a season meant for our growth in the moral life For this reason our readings often reflect themes that involve the calling of the Apostles as we hear today and of our Lord's moral teachings and parables that we will hear from in two weeks time Advent Supply Drive for The Closet special Thank You to all those who helped support our Advent Supply Drive for The Closet an outreach of our local Family Centered Services Because of your generosity we were not only able to provide for all of the requested items but were also able to make a generous financial donation on behalf of our parish family What better way to have prepared for the birth of the Savior then by supporting expectant mothers their unborn children and new families right here in our own community The Catholic Parent Six Week Video Series Next Sunday we will begin The Catholic Parent a six week video series from <a href=\"Formed.org\">Formed.org</a> focusing on
