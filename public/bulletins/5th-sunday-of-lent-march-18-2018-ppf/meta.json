TRANSFIGURATION IT IS ETERNAL LIFE IN CHRIST My dear brothers and sisters in Christ the Lord be with you I wish you all Happy St Joseph Feast Day tomorrow Monday March 19th 2018 our Patron Saint Bodily Penance etc as stated above is true for those who keep Gods commandments and live out their Baptismal commitment with the Lord That is the reason the Lord God says in the 1st Reading Jer 313134 The days are coming says the Lord our God when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel The new covenant was made in Christ through Baptism It is to destroy sin that Christ was born He suffered and died and of course rose We need to be loyal to God Disloyalty disobedience destroys the life of Christ in us God in His infinite wisdom wrote his commandment in our hearts and not on the tablets of stone Why was the Commandment written on the tablets of stone This is your assignment take home question In the 2nd Reading Heb 579 the author of the letter to the Hebrews wrote that Christ offered prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to God for our sins and the pains of suffering he was to undergo to save us from death of sin was too heavy on him The experience of abandonment our sins caused Christ great pains that he bled blood in the garden of Gethsemane Let us avoid sin so that we do not again cause Him this kind of unbearable pains In the Gospel Jn 122033 Philip and Andrew led some people to Jesus Think about it How many people have you led to Jesus In this Gospel story we see the mystery of abiding in Christ The grain of wheat which falls to the ground and dies in order to produce an abundance of grains which transcends itself in both quantity and quality so shall we be transformed in quality in Christ if we live in Christ and be faithful to our Baptismal promises Thus to hate oneself or lose ones life means to be willing to give up conveniences and accept inconveniences in life for the sake of Christ It is surrendering oneself to God for the sake of our neighbor For our salva tion we need one another We need to help one another as some Greeks needed the help of Philip to see Jesus Philip needed the assistance of Andrew and both helped those and they saw Jesus As the Greeks needed Jesus so we need Him Let us go to him for our salvation Let us not fear death For all of us will face death It is unavoid able and necessary end Death is not annihilation of the human person but a transfor mation resulting in a glorious resurrection What we need to fear is sin which de stroys life Question Why was the commandment written on two tablets of stone It was written on two tablets of stone for one tablet is in relation to God the other is in relation to one another Why was the commandment written on tablets of stone It was written on stone so that you either keep it or you break it otherwise the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve will not be able to bend the Commandments of God God bless you Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 Every Second and
