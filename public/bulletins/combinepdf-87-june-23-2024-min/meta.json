June 22nd 23rd the Church throughout the world celebrates the Twelfth Sunday in Ordinary Time In addition to this celebration for the universal Church our parish Church also has an additional celebration today the fifty eighth anniversary of the dedication of our church building Liturgically this celebration is considered a solemnity meaning that our parish is able to celebrate it even in the midst of Ordinary Time Fifty eight years ago on June 26 1966 Fr Bob Traub our eighth resident pastor was joined by Bishop Leo Pursley the sixth bishop of our diocese to dedicate our new church building By all accounts it was a sweltering Sunday as the temperature rose to a high of 93F Yet the blazing heat didn't keep parishioners from attending as the newly built church was said to be overflowing by the time that the Mass of dedication started Though we will still hear the readings for the Twelfth Sunday in Ordinary Time today the prayers of the Mass will come from the Common of the Dedication of a Church on the Anniversary of the Dedication In these prayers we give thanks to God for this very building a visible sign of the Church herself It is in this visible house that God let us build that He wonderfully manifests and accomplishes the mystery of His communion with us Every year around this time I often reflect on the words that Fr Traub shared in preparation for the building of the new church in the 1960s This building will serve as a testimony to our story the vibrant epic of the way in which the life of God is nourished in our souls It begins with the first blessing sought by the expectant mother for her newly conceived child and ends only with the last benediction begged by grieving families for their departed loved ones During all the years in between filled with work and rest joy and sorrow pleasure and pain the Altar is the center of our attention Our freely offered sacrifices at this time will be recognition of the value we place upon our supernatural life and our desire for it to grow stronger in St Joseph Parish And every year these words strike me as even more true and beautiful As our parish family continues to grow I think of how our church building itself serves as a place of encounter with Jesus Christ in a real and unique way Greeted in Baptism strengthened in Holy Communion and Confirmation forgiven in Confession and wept over in death The steps between the nave and the sanctuary bridge the gap between heaven and earth It is here that we go up the mountain of the Lord and here where the Lord comes to His people Though it is the fifty eighth anniversary of this church building our parish is nearing its 150th anniversary Officially established as a parish in 1875 this coming year of 2025 will mark our sesquicentennial celebration It is my hope that this coming year will be one not only filled with great celebrations to mark this wondrous anniversary but as a chance to renew our commitment to serving our neighbors right here in our local community Parish Council Nominations Please return any remaining nominations for the Parish Council either to the Parish Office or in the collection
