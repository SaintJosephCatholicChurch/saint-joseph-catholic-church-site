10 Sun Feb 16 Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time Jer 175 8 Ps 11 4 6 1 Cor 1512 16 20 Mk 811 13 Fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time February 9 2025 This weekend February 8th9th the Church celebrates the Fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time Our readings for this Sunday combine two major themes awe and apostolate In our first reading and our Gospel both Isaiah and Peter are awed and ashamed to find themselves in the presence of God Yet despite this both are still sent out apostello in Greek on a mission for God in service to the world which is called an apostolate Like Isaiah and Peter there might be times when we too feel our own unworthiness and need of mercy in Gods presence Yet like them God is still willing to send us out as well just as we are sent out at the end of every Mass Go and proclaim the Gospel of the Lord The Lord often trusts us even more than we trust ourselves For this reason each of us shares in a common apostolate through our baptism to spread the good news of mercy to all people Living with the Saints Learning About Their Lives As announced at the start of this liturgical year our theme for the liturgical year is Living with the Saints One of the ways we embraced this theme was with our annual choosing of a Saint to walk with into the New Year on the Solemnity of Mary Mother of God Another way that we will continue to embrace this theme throughout the year is to highlight the lives of various Saints on our bulletin cover whenever the weekend allows Ordinary Time is often a wonderful season to look into the lives of the Saints These many weeks are often interwoven with the memorials and feasts of so many holy men and women that we can learn so much from Our bulletin cover this weekend highlights St Scholastica whose feast day is this coming Monday Feb 10th The short story of her life comes from our weekly offering of The Kid's Bulletin available in the narthex for our younger parishioners The story reflected on the bulletin cover is one of the more famous accounts of St Scholastica's life Following after her twin brother St Benedict St Scholastica founded a convent near Monte Cassino in Italy The two would meet once a year to visit and on their last visit before St Scholastica's death she prayed for more time with him In answer to her prayers a sudden storm miraculously arose preventing his departure so they could visit a bit longer Today St Scholastica is recognized as the patron saint of Benedictine nuns education and is often invoked for protection from storms and rain Parish Game Night Join us for a Parish Game Night next Saturday February 15th in the Parish Social Hall following the 5:00PM vigil Mass Learning from the example of Sts Scholastica and Benedict sometimes the most precious moments are the moments when we have the chance to simply visit with one another Such so cial gatherings such as Parish Game Night allows us to gather as a parish family and spend that precious time visiting with one another Winter Weather Reminder With the recent inclement weather and the unpredictability of Indiana weather patterns please remember that our weekend Masses will always be offered as scheduled at St Josephs Saturday Vigil Mass 5 PM Sunday Masses 7:30AM and 10 AM As disciples of the Lord we have a positive obligation to keep holy the Lords Day and when we are physically able to to gather together to worship at the Sacrifice of the Mass The above being said an obligation does assume that that which is asked of us is physically possible If the weather is bad roads are impassable and you do not feel safe traveling in the icy weather please stay safe and stay home Please Note Next weekend Feb 15th 16th we welcome Fr Bill Sullivan as the main celebrant for all of our Masses At this time of year I often travel with several of my seminary classmates for retreat Sadly our schedules did not allow for gathering this year I will still however be taking this scheduled time away for some prayer and rest in preparation for the beginning of Lent Weekend of February 15th 16th 500 David Smith 730 Mike Morrissey 1000 Jay CrispAdult Choir 500 Stacey Coulardot 730 Barb Ault 1000 Monica Harris 500 Dan
