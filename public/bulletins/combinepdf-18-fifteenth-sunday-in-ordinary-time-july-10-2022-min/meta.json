  "text": "Fifteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time July 10 2022 This weekend July 9th 10th the Church celebrates the Fifthteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time As previously mentioned there are thirty four weeks of Ordinary Time This means that throughout the past liturgical year we have already seen unfolded before our eyes the entire series of the Mysteries of our Redemption from Advent to the Ascension And yet we still have nearly half the liturgical year ahead of us Having celebrated the sublime drama that absorbed our very existence we now enter into this time to reflect on what we have experienced The celebration of these mysteries cannot be an empty pageant acted only for the sake of being looked at Instead the mystery of Salvation must influence every aspect of our lives What we have experienced in the liturgical year and now hear proclaimed in the Gospels is meant to further the Christian life in our lives To truly put into practice that which we have received Throughout these many weeks we are given the example of the Saints as witnesses who have kept the Faith 2 Timothy 47 8 We share in the sufferings that the Saints lived out and exult in the triumphs that they have won out The numerous feast days over these many months and throughout the whole year often celebrated during our weekday Masses are meant to serve as a reminder The Saints are in union with Jesus Christ in Heaven And this unity now lived out by the Saints in Heaven is a unity which we are called to join In our Kid's Bulletin our youth are offered a look into the life of different Saints This weekend focuses on St Bonaventure the 14th Century Franciscan and a Doctor of the Church whose feast day falls this Friday July 15th This weekly offering is meant to remind our youth that they have friends in Heaven And no matter how wise we might become in years we too should never forget this simple lesson We have friends in Heaven And we should learn about them Another great Saint celebrated this week is St Kateri Tekakwitha On Thursday July 14th we celebrate the Memorial of St Kateri a 17th Century Algonquin Mohawk convert to the Catholic Faith Her mother was a Christian Algonquin taken captive by the Iroquois and given as wife to the chief of the Mohawk clan When Kateri was four she lost her parents and little brother in a smallpox epidemic that left her disfigured and half blind She was adopted by her uncle who succeeded her father as chief Kateri was moved by the words of three Jesuit missionaries who lodged with her uncle but fear kept her from seeking instruction As she grew she refused to marry a Mohawk brave and at age 19 courageously took the step of converting She was baptized with the name Kateri Catherine on Easter Sunday in 1676 For accepting baptism she was treated as an outcast among her own community For her own safety she walked 200 miles to a Christian Indian village at Sault St Louis near Montreal Over the next three years Kateri gave herself totally to God in long hours of prayer in charity and in acts of penance At the age of 23 Kateri took a vow of virginity an unprecedented act for an Indian woman whose future depended on being married After undergoing a long illness Kateri passed into her reward on April 17 1680 Those who were with her testified that at her death her smallpox scars disappeared and her skin became radiant She quickly became known as the Lily of the Mohawks as knowledge of her life spread Parish Council Nominations As a reminder please submit all nominations for our two open Parish Council seats no later than next Sunday July 17th
