  "text": "Twenty Fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time September 18 2022 This weekend Sept 17th 18th the Church celebrates the Twenty fifth Sunday of Ordinary Time In our local community we will celebrate the annual Bluffton Free Street Fair throughout the coming week When Street Fair began in 1898 our parish had already been around for over 23 years At the time we were a mission parish under the guidance of Rev Rudolph Denk the second pastor of St Aloysius in Sheldon now known as Yoder Continuing in our theme of communal outreach our parish has a space reserved along West Washington Street near the library throughout Street Fair It is my hope that we will be able to have a presence throughout most of the week We will be setting up a table where we hope to have information about the parish a box for prayer intentions a variety of literature and pamphlets about the Catholic Faith water to give out and a drawing for a free bible And most importantly smiling faces Take a Stand for Life Next Saturday Sept 24th at 11 AM our parish will be hosting the Wells County Regional Rally for the Right to Life of Northeast Indiana This peaceful gathering is meant to draw together those who are willing to stand beside mothers in need and families as well as faith leaders and our pro life legislators in a loving manner It will also help lead our parish into the Forty Days for Life Campaign running from September 28th through November 6th Though we may now be in a post Roe world this does not mean that our advocacy for life ends as seen by our participation in the above events We must strive not simply to see an end to the evils of abortion but work build up a culture of life in all things and at every stage of life To learn where we as a state are currently in this fight join us for our Discussion Forum on Abortion on Thursday September 29th at 7:30PM in the Parish Social Hall This forum will look at both the morality and legality of abortion With the Dobbs Decision the Supreme Court returned regulation of abortion back to the individual States To help navigate the legal framework of both the Dobbs Decision and Indiana's most recent legislation we will be joined by Colin Andrews parishioner and Wells County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney and Kent Kiracofe a St Al's parishioner and Wells County Circuit Court Judge In addition to the above offerings we are happy to announce a transition of leadership within our Pro Life Committee After many years of service to our parish on this committee current co chairs Mike and Debbie Lautzenheiser have passed on the leadership role to Nick and Hannah Boratenski We thank Mike and Debbie for their dutiful service and welcome Nick and Hannah to this new role See next weekend's bulletin column for a note from Nick Did You Know Gifts of Bread and Wine For many centuries the Faithful brought bread and wine from their homes to the church to be used for the Mass and to be given to the clergy and the poor Today a similar offering for the parish and the poor is made with our monetary contributions At the Offertory members of the parish will take up a collection from the assembly and bring it to the priest at the altar with the bread and wine to be used for the sacrifice The priest places the bread and wine on the table He then mixes water with the wine and washes his hands to help us think of the Last Supper Mixing water with wine and washing hands were common Jewish practices during the life of Jesus Finally he invites us to pray that the sacrifice be acceptable to God We respond Amen to the Prayer Over the Gifts and stand to participate in the central prayer of the Mass the Liturgy of the Eucharist In giving our gifts over to God whether it be bread and wine or a monetary donation we are setting these gifts apart for God And the Son in returns lifts them up transforms them and gives them over to the Father This humble and simple action is meant to call to mind how we are called to make ourselves a gift to the Lord and allow Him to work in and through us MASS INTENTIONS Saturday September 17 8:00am Special Intention 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Special Intentions

bless the new playground which sits on the south side of the Church Campus Fr David was joined by the students and catechists on their first day of the new Religious Education year HE ASS IN LOW OTION Rev Ronald Knox Chapter VI The Offertory Part I Its all very well for you to point out that the Offertory is only concerned with unconsecrated bread and wine and that isnt much to get excited about Thats quite true of course but I t h ink if you will use your imagination for a moment you will see that there is good excuse for making a lot of the unconsecrated host and the unconsecrated chalice They may have no great importance of their own at the moment but they are go ing to be terrifically important And it can become very narrow minded of us if we think only of what things are at the moment not of what they are going to be Imagine yourself walking through a field of wheat out in the park say by the deer cote All those ears of wheat are full of promise they are going to be something That particular ear of wheat which is sticking out on the left of the path will be threshed ground in the mill baked in the oven made into a sandwich and be eaten by somebody on a railway journey that is the destiny which is shaping itself inside that particular set of little husks Now look at that ear of wheat which is sticking out on the right of the path That one will be threshed ground in the mill the same mill baked in t he oven no not in the same oven or at any rate not in the same batch there will be no baking powder this time Then it will be pressed by a Carmelite nun in a press which will give it the imprint of the crucifix it will be sent off in a tin to the sac ristan of some church it will lie on the altar some Latin words will be said over it and after that it will be lifted up in a gold monstrance and everybody who passes in front of it will go down on both knees Its the same with the chalice only of c ourse we arent so familiar with the process of making wine That duster over there will find its way into a bottle of ordinary wine somebody will drink it over his dinner get drunk on it perhaps and come to blows and be sent to prison That other du ster will find its way into a bottle of altar wine will be consecrated will be drunk by a priest and bring him just the grace he needed to resist that temptation to rise to that height of sanctity And yet the two clusters grew side by side in the same vineyard long ago So what the priest is doing at the altar is to separate to earmark this particular lump of wheat this particular dose of wine for a supernatural destiny And that of course is just what is happening to you and me all the time Sooner or later we shall die and that moment of death will be please God our Consecration we shall be changed into something different be given a spiritual body in place of our natural body and live praising God among the Saints to all eternity What we are doing now all the time is to make of our lives an Offertory to Almighty God to separate them set them apart for him so that when death comes it may be our Consecration And that is why the pious books will tell you at the Offertory to put yourself in imagination on the paten between the priests hands We mustnt despise then the unconsecrated host which the priest is holding up in front of the crucifix the drops of wine which are trickling down into the chalice we must think of what they are going to be he w hole idea of the Offertory is that the bread and wine are something which YOU hand over to ME which the faithful hand over to the priest to see what he can make of them Thats why I say that this is the point where YOU come in Those two small servers i n red cassocks one of them with hicc up's and the other with his shoelace undone represent you represent the congregation In theory you are all crowding on to the sanctuary turning the priests solitary dance into a tumultuous round dance all holding out pieces of bread and shouting Father Knox Father Knox Do bless this one Thats what the Offertory really is only you arent actually expected to do quite that You are expected to place your body in your imagination beside the host on the paten and to say Dear God this ridiculous thing is all I have to offer you please make something of it Yes let us get excited about the unconsecrated bread and wine because of what they are going to be but d ont lets lose sight of the fact that what they are going to be depends entirely on what God is going to do with them WE could wave them about in the air and repeat words over them from morning until night and they would remain simply ordinary bread and wine even still its only because God is going to take a hand in it that they are going to become something quite different That is the whole point of the Offertory to remind us how little it is we offer so that when we get to the Consecration we may be bowled over more than ever by the thought of what He makes of it Joan Phelps Parishioner MA NCC LMHC LCAC CADAC ICAC CCDP Licensed Mental Health Counselor Individual Marriage Family Counseling Addictions Counseling SpiritualPastoral Counseling
