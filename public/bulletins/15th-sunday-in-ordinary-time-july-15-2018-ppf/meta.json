Parish Family Fr David Violi Installed Pastor of St Joseph Church Bluffton July 14 2018 by Bishop Kevin Rhoades Jesus our great High Priest hear our humble prayers on behalf of your priest Father David Violi Give him a deep faith a bright and firm hope and a burning love which will ever increase in the course of his priestly life In his loneliness comfort him In his sorrows strengthen him In his frustrations point out to him That it is through suffering that the soul is purified and show him that he is needed by the church he is needed by souls he is needed for the work of redemption loving Mother Mary Mother of Priests take to your heart your son who is close to you because of his priestly ordination and because of the power which he has received to carry on the work of Christ in a world which needs him so much Amen MASS INTENTIONS Saturday July 14 7:45am Morning Prayer 8:00am No Intention 8:30am Rosary 4:00pm Confessions 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Parish Family Sunday July 15

for our Saturday Vigil Mass During this Mass the Bishop will formally install me as the pastor of our parish This rite will start following the homily and consists of four parts Renewal of Priestly Promises Presentation of Parish Council and Staff Recitation of the Creed and the Oath of Fidelity First the Bishop will ask me to renew the promises that each priest makes at their ordination In doing this I am reminded that I serve our parish as a represen tative of the Church and the Bishop and as such my life must be an example of the Gospel message Then the Bishop will present to me our parish staff and mem bers of our parish council This is a reminder to me that the ministry of the pastor is one that can only be done in union with his parishioners Next leading the parish in the recitation of the Nicene Creed we reaffirm our belief as a Church in the most basic tenets of our faith This is a reminder that we as a Church and a parish are to be united as one John 1721 through our belief in Jesus Finally in making the Oath of Fidelity I reaffirm my commitment to faith fully serve as pastor of our parish In this oath I am reminded that as pastor I am not speaking on behalf of myself but Jesus To conclude the formal installation rite both Bishop and I will sign two docu ments at the altar recognizing that I have both professed the Creed and made the Oath of Fidelity We then continue into the Liturgy of the Eucharist in which we see the Sacrifice of Christ that not only the pastor but each of us as Christians is called to imitate in our own lives Following Mass where we have joined together in prayer we then join together for community and fellowship with a reception in the Social Hall We are to truly be united together as one family in Christ For the installation rite the readings we hear are taken from this weekend meaning they are the readings for the 15th Sunday in Ordinary Time Though not planned they provide great insight for the installation rite They are a great re minder that each of us not simply the priest is called to be a missionary and to help spread the Gospel everyone in the world In our first reading Amos is given a difficult task Though not a prophet he has been sent by God to call Bethel to repentance Bethel does not wish to receive this message and sends Amos away St Paul writing from prison reminds us that each of us are chosen by God and have been given a purpose If we are willing to trust in the Lord He Himself will guide us Finally in the Gospel Jesus sends out His disciples In sending them out He re minds them to always trust that God will provide for them Though they may be rejected by those to whom they are sent they must still try and bring the Good News of Jesus Christ to the whole world And in trusting in God His Will will be done May each of us seek to bring Jesus Christ into the world and into the life of every person that we meet today In Christ Fr David SCRIPTUREMASS READINGS FOR THE WEEK Mon July 16
