Sunday of Advent December 21 2025 special Welcome Home to all our university students on their winter break and all of our military personnel on leave with us this coming Christmastide This weekend Dec 20th 21st the Church celebrates the Fourth Sunday of Advent As we enter the final days that lead us to Christmas we count down the remaining hours until we celebrate the birth of the Messiah In these last days the Church invites us to step back from the noise of the world and seek out that quiet in our hearts just as Israel once went into the wilderness to hear the voice of John so that we may prepare more faithfully and joyfully to welcome our Redeemer on Christmas Day This quiet of the heart can be found in simple practices such as lighting the candles of our Advent wreath praying together as a family or contemplating the Nativity scene In each of these moments we are preparing our hearts to welcome the Christ child Reducing distractions and practicing small acts of charity create space for grace When our homes become places of prayer and love they truly become a dwelling place for the newborn King Christmas Mass Schedule Each Christmas Mass reveals a different facet of the same great mystery On Christmas Eve the Church turns our eyes to the long waiting of Israel showing us that the Child in the manger was promised from the beginning At Midnight heaven breaks its silence as the angels proclaim His birth And on Christmas Day St John lifts the veil and shows us who the Child truly is the eternal Word made flesh Emmanuel God with us Similarly each of our Masses offer a unique element On Christmas Eve Wednesday Dec 24th Mass will be offered at 4 PM and 6 PM The 4 PM Mass will include the blessing of our Nativity scene in the Church and music will be led by our Children's Choir The 6 PM Mass will have music led by our Adult Choir in addition to a prelude of Christmas Music and Carols at 5:30PM prior to Mass to raise our hearts in preparation for Mass On Christmas Day Thursday Dec 25th Mass will be offered at both Midnight and 9 AM The Midnight Mass which is at midnight will be offered solely by candlelight and Christmas lights The 9 AM Mass will have a Christmas Brunch offered afterwards in the Parish Social Hall If you are planning to attend our annual Christmas Day Brunch please see the sign up sheet in the Narthex this weekend As always we are preparing to welcome many guests this Christmas season Thank you ahead of time for your warm and welcoming embrace for those joining us If you know of someone with nowhere to go please invite them to

light in the world Thanks to your generosity this Advent the joy of Christ's coming is already being made visible in the lives of so many Parish Renovations Volunteer Opportunities As a reminder in
