begin the 6th Sunday in Ordinary Time we are only three weeks away from Ash Wednesday and the beginning of our Lenten Season As we will soon walk these 40 days of prayer and fasting to more fully unite ourselves to the joy of Easter Sunday now is as good a time as any to begin prayerfully discerning what Lenten observances we will follow While in the seminary we had the practice of undertaking three bona opera or good works as part of our Lenten discipline This practice historically originated from the 6th Century Rule of St Benedict which guides the life of monks living in community This is a practice that I try to continue each year and would invite you to do the same this Lenten Season In the seminary we divided the bona opera into three categories fasting charita ble work and spiritual growth To fast we abstain from some practice eg watching televi sion or indulgence eg hitting the snooze button throughout the Lenten Season This self denial serves as a reminder that we live not for the things of this world but for God alone To perform charitable work we commit ourselves to perform some form of outreach eg volunteering at a nursing home or provide for those in need eg donating to a charity This giving of ourselves serves as a reminder that we can glimpse the face of Jesus Christ anew each and everyday in the faces of our brothers and sisters in need Finally to grow spiritually we commit ourselves to some additional form of prayer or devotion throughout Lent This practice can take on either a personal commitment such as dedicating an addi tional 15 minutes each day to reflecting on the Sacred Scriptures or a communal commit ment such as joining in the Stations of the Cross each Friday or making an effort to attend an additional daily Mass each week This time spent in prayer allows us to be more attentive to the voice of God speaking to us Whichever form our Lenten devotions may take let us spend these next three weeks prayerfully discerning how the Lord is calling us to use these coming 40 days This time of penance is meant to open our hearts and allow the light of God to pour into our souls These 40 days of Lent are too precious and pass too quickly to risk approaching un prepared Over the next few weeks our schedule of liturgies and devotions for Lent will be included in the bulletin May each and every one of us be preparing to have a good and a challenging Lent Scriptural Reflection for the 6th Sunday of Ordinary Time Having heard the vocational call of the prophets Jeremiah and Isaiah we now hear Jeremiah fulfilling his vocation as a prophet in our first reading Jeremiah 1758 The Lords mes sage to Israel is very similar to the message that He gave to Jeremiah when He was first called him Trust in the Lord always or as our psalm response echoes Blessed are they who hope in the Lord The Lord is chastising Judah for constantly choosing to follow men over Himself And as they see time and time again in their journey their faith is in vain when placed in other men It is only when they place their faith and their trust in God alone that they find true prosperity and joy This sentiment is reflected by St Paul in our second reading 1 Corinthians 1512 1620 Our hope is in our Lord Jesus Christ Having reasserted the basic truths of the Faith or the kerygma Greek for preaching St Paul now reaffirms the truth of the resurrection We cannot simply find Jesus Christ to be a good teacher and nothing more He is truly our Sav iour who has defeated death and calls each and every one of us to eternal life To deny this as some of the Corinthians have begun to do makes faith meaningless For this reason St Paul offers this beautiful passage as a reminder to the Corinthians and us today that we cannot waterdown the Gospel message To do so renders it ineffective and meaningless a message that cannot save Instead we are a people called to faith and to place our trust en tirely in our risen Lord Such faith when placed in God is never in vain Our Lord Himself in our Gospel Luke 617 2026 continues this call to trust In His ser mon on the Plain paralleled with Matthews account of the Sermon on the Mount Matthew 517 11 Jesus teaches the crowd the path to obtain true happiness This path though seems very difficult and one full of many trials In His enumeration of the Beatitudes the careful listener finds those called blessed to be ones suffering greatly In the same vein those cautioned with woes would in a worldly sense seem to be those who are prospering in this life Yet the Lord calls us time and time again to go further than we ever think possi ble to trust in Him completely Worldly prosperity can never satisfy the human heart Those who are satisfied in this world are cautioned so that they may not grow complacent and may never forget that we live not for this world but for life in the world to come Those who are suffering as they live out the Gospel message are reminded to remain steadfast and to continue on the narrow way For it is the narrow way that will lead us to beatitude and the heavenly kingdom It is only this that will satisfy us it is only true union with God that will fulfill the longing of our hearts Our Lords words seem a great reversal and that is exactly what they are He challenges us today to take a deep look at our own lives and to reflect upon them Are we living for the luxury of this world or are we striving for something greater How can we incorporate the Beatitudes into our lives In Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF February 2324 2019 CANTORS 500 Marita Crawfis 730 Donna
