IN ORDINARY TIME January 19 2020 Following the Baptism of the Lord this weekend brings the Church into the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time Though this season is the longest in the entire Church year running for 34 weeks throughout the year we will only be in it briefly at this time until the beginning of Lent on Ash Wednesday February 26th At this time we are called to put into practice that great gift which we have received and experienced throughout the Christmas season This gift of Christmas is of course Jesus Christ For this reason and to remove all doubt we hear from the Gospel of St John today as we enter into this new season And as we have heard St John the Baptist clearly testifies that Jesus is the Son of God John 134 After this proclamation from the Gospel of St John we will return to the Gospel of St Matthew with a brief interlude from the Gospel of St Luke on the Feast of the Presentation St Matthew writing towards a JewishChristian audience will focus his Gospel on Jesus as the King of Israel and what it means to truly be a disciple of the Lord Respect Life This past Friday we had an opportunity to screen 2019s critically acclaimed film Unplanned This lifechanging film followed the journey of Abby Johnson the youngest clinic director in the history of Planned Parenthood as she resigned her position from the abortion clinic and joined the Coalition for Life a prayerbased prolife ministry This past Saturday many parishioners travelled to Fort Wayne to participate in the Allen County March for Life This yearly march gathers thousands from the Fort Waynearea to serve as a witness to and support for the dignity of all hu man life from conception to natural death These events lead us into a day of prayer and fasting this coming Wednesday January 22nd January 22nd will mark the 47th anniversary of both Roe vs Wade and the lesser known Doe vs Bolton These two Supreme Court decisions called abortion a constitutional right and removed many of the factors limiting abortions throughout our country Since that time over 66 million children have lost their lives through abortion in our country alone On this day we are urged to work and pray for an end to the evil that is abortion in our country and throughout the world We are also called to pray for all those who find themselves in a situation that would lead them to consider an abortion All human persons from conception to natural death have an inherent dignity and an inalienable right to life Though prolife issues garner a special focus in our minds this week as this sorrowful anniversary approaches they are issues that should guide us each and everyday of our lives The respect of human life and the building up of the culture of life occurs in the everyday moments that we face when we are facetoface with family neighbor friend and stranger It starts first and foremost right at home in our families In his encyclical The Gospel of Life Evangelium Vitae Pope St John Paul II beautifully states that as the domestic church the family is summoned to proclaim celebrate and serve the Gospel of life In the family each new life is to be seen as a gift received from God for we are a people of reception Once we are able to truly see each life as a gift from God how we approach one another will forever be changed Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF JANUARY 2526 2020
