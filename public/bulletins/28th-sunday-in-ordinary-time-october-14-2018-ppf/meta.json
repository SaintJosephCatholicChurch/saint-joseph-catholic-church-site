Parish Picnic and Chili CookOff Work on both our Parking Lot and Church Security projects continue We are in the process of receiving bids from various companies for both projects We hope to implement part of the Church Security project this winter and to begin the Parking Lot project by spring More information will be shared as we move along with the projects After our last Parish Council meeting we will be working with Our Sunday Visi tor to make online giving an available tithing option at St Josephs in addition to our normal Sunday envelopes We hope to make this option available to all pa rishioners starting in November Next week all are invited to attend our parish Discussion Forum regarding the scandals in the Church Given the importance and seriousness of this topic we will offer two opportunities Sunday October 21 between Masses 830945 am and Wednesday October 24 at 7:30pm following 700 Mass St Michael the Archangel in Sacred Scripture Throughout the Sacred Scriptures we occasionally hear references to the differ ent angels that serve as Gods messengers throughout both the Old and New Tes taments Among these is St Michael the Archangel who is referenced by name in the Book of Daniel the Epistle of Jude and the Book of Revelation The early Church Fathers often also associated him indirectly as the archangel referred to in Numbers 2 Chronicles and 1 Thessalonians In the Book of Daniel St Michael first appears to strengthen and reassure Daniel as he fights against the King of Persia Dan 101321 Next Daniel says that St Michael will reappear at the end times to protect Gods people Dan 121 In the Epistle of Jude the author warning against false teachers cites St Michael as guarding the tomb of Moses against Satan Jude 19 Finally in the Book of Revelation we hear of how St Michael led the angels of God against Satan the dragon and his fallen angels Rev 1279St Michael and his army are victori ous in this battle and Satan and the fallen angels or demons fall from heaven In these passages of Sacred Scriptures we see that St Michael wages war against and serves to protect us from Satan Next week we will look at the history of St Michael through Sacred Tradition Reflection on our Scripture Passages for the 28th Sunday in Ordinary Time In our first reading from the Book of Wisdom Wis 7711 the author praises the wisdom of King Solomon When given the choice by God for one thing Solomon chooses not worldly or material wealth but instead asks for wisdom This desire for wisdom for knowledge of truth brings Solomon into a deeper relationship with God This desire for relationship consumes Solomon and God becomes the center of his life In our Gospel Mark 101730 the young man is offered the same choice as Solomon As a man who is living a moral life he is asked by our Lord to go even further and make God the absolute center of his life The young man having many possessions and many other things in his life is challenged by this call The call is made but the response is his own This same call to put God as the abso lute center of our lives as disciples is made to each of us How will we respond In Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF October 2021 2018
