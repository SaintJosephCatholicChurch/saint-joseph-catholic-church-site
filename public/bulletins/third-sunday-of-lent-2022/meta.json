  "text": "Third Sunday of Lent March 20 2022 This weekend the Church celebrates the Third Sunday of Lent We are nearing the halfway point of the Lenten season with the celebration of Laetare Sunday next weekend This is as always a good opportunity to ensure that we are approaching this season with humility and an openness to God's will If we feel that we are slipping in our Lenten observances or fallen away from them completely let us renew our efforts here and now May we always remember as we learn from the Stations of the Cross that our Lord Himself falls three times along the way to Calvary Each time however He picks Himself up and continues His journey for our sake In the same way Jesus calls us to pick up the cross and carry along the way throughout this Lenten season In doing so we will find that everything we do this Lent will lead us to a greater love of God special Thank You to all those who helped with our St Joseph Table for this weekend Though we are not able to transfer the celebration of the Solemnity of St Joseph to Sundays in Lent we can still celebrate our parish patron in this little way May St Joseph Foster Father of our Lord and Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary continue to watch over the Body of Christ here on earth the Church in the same way that he watched over the Christ Child at their home in Nazareth Act of Consecration of Russia and Ukraine Pope Francis will lead an Act of Consecration of Russia and Ukraine to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on March 25th the Solemnity of the Annunciation at 5:00PM Roman time 12:00PM EST The Holy Father has invited all bishops the world over to join him in this act of consecration Bishop Rhoades has in turn invited the priests of our diocese and all the Faithful to join together in this prayer for peace Given this request by Pope Francis and Bishop Rhoades I invite all those who are able to join together this Friday March 25th at Noon in the Church as we pray for peace in Ukraine Russia and throughout the whole world In addition to the consecratory prayers that may be offered we will also join together in praying the Rosary Did You Know The Church and Salvation The Catholic Church views salvation as the forgiveness of sins and restoration of friendship with God In this way our salvation begins with our Baptism and being our relationship with God is a journey that will continue throughout our entire lifetime For this reason we often find the Sacred Scriptures speaking of salvation in the past tense cf Ephesians 28 9 the present tense cf Philippians 212 and the future tense cf Romans 1311 1 Corinthians 315 55 We believe that salvation is the process by which we come closer to God throughout our whole life in part by our participation in the Sacraments and the grace that comes through them This does not mean however that man's salvation is based upon himself or his own action God the Father planned our salvation God the Son gained our salvation through His death and resurrection God the Holy Spirit infused the very love of God into our hearts by His presence cf Romans 55 Salvation does not come from man's own action but is instead a cooperation with God's grace throughout our lives as we seek eternal happiness with Him in heaven This cooperation is rooted in our faith in Jesus Christ cf Romans 109 which is essential to salvation As the Sacred Scriptures profess we must live out our faith through a life of obedience and good works cf James 217 Salvation is a process with many points of justification which is the renewal of our relationship with God along the path to heaven Salvation prepares us throughout our life for heaven where we will share His holiness Hebrews 1210 for all eternity Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday
