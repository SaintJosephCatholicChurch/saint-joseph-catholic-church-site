January 7 2024 Safe travels and God's blessing upon this new academic year to our college students returning to school this and in the coming weeks This weekend Jan 6th 7th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord Marking the twelfth day of the Christmas season this solemnity is one of our more ancient celebrations on the liturgical calendar In the first centuries of the Church the celebration of both Christmas Day and the Epiphany were often celebrated on the same day It was only in the 4th Century that these two solemnities began to be celebrated separately By the Council of Tours in the 6th Century the Church universally set both Christmas Day and Epiphany as separate feast days on Dec 25 and Jan 6 respectively The twelve days between the feasts were known as the Christmas season Even with this clear separation from Christmas Day Epiphany still encompassed at least three different scriptural celebrations The Visitation of the Magi the Baptism of the Lord and the Wedding Feast at Cana Each of these scriptural celebrations are true reflections of the very word epiphany which means manifestation as each emphasizes the various revelations of Jesus divinity to the world Over time the Christmas season grew beyond twelve days as these various scriptural celebrations received their own feast days This is reflected even today in that our Christmas season doesn't end until the celebration of the Baptism of the Lord on Monday As with previous years we will allow the beauty of Christmas to echo within our hearts and our Church for the weeks to come Our beautiful decora tions will only slowly begin to be put away following the Baptism of the Lord Our Nativity scene and perhaps a few other decorations will remain as visible sources of prayerful meditation until the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord or Candlemas Candlemas served as the traditional end of the Christmas season by the end of the 7th Century Even today as it is a feast of the Lord it represents the last visible ripples of Christmas in our current liturgical calendar Though the visible liturgical aspects of the Christmas season will slowly fade away the joy of the Incarnation is to remain ever alive in our hearts Epiphany Chalk and House Blessing The cover of this weekend's bulletin offers a description of the Epiphany House Blessing Epiphany Chalk and Holy Water will be blessed at all Masses this weekend and available in the narthex This powerful sacramental is a centuries old practice that is meant to serve as a sign of our dedication to the Lord In this blessing we are to be reminded every time we see the inscription over the door that our homes and all those who dwell here belong to Christ Teaching Mass Thursday January 11th at 6:30PM This Thursday I will be offering a Teaching Mass in the Church as a part of our Catholicism Explained Series What is a Teaching Mass It is not a Mass Instead it is a walk through of the Mass that looks at the various prayers items and practices found in our liturgy This allows for a thorough overview of the Mass and chance to answer any questions you might have Though a part of our Catholic Explained Series this event is open to all on Thursday January 11th at 6:30PM The Catholic Parent Sunday Video Series In two weeks time we will be offering The Catholic Parent a six week video series on Sunday
