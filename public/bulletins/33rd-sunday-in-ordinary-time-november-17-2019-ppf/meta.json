CHRIST KING OF THE UNIVERSE 2 Sm 513 Col 11220 Lk 233543 THIRTYTHIRD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME November 117 2019 Thank you for the warm welcome that you showed Fr Dermot Gahan last week end I had a very renewing and spiritually uplifting time in Rome but am very happy to be back home at St Josephs Frs Bob Nathan and I had the chance to pray at many holy sites offer Mass in many different churches including St Peters several times and visit with our seminarians priests and friends studying and working in Rome and the Vatican Below you will find a picture of the three of us with Mark Hellinger 2nd Theol ogy Zane Langenbrunner 1st Theology and Sam Anderson 1st Theology at the North American College in Rome We also visited with Fr Spenser St Louis who is finishing his final classes in Rome before returning home to our diocese this June These men are studying diligently and giving up so much especially being so far away from their fami lies and friends so that they will be better prepared to serve as priests for our diocese May we continue to pray for them and all those discerning a call to priestly and religious life It truly is a life worth living One many gracefilled moments I experienced was at the adoration chapel in St John Lateran While there I was moved by so many young adults who came into the chapel to spend a moment with Jesus As Pope Francis wrote in Christus Vivit Christ is Alive With a friend we can speak and share our deepest secrets With Jesus too we can always have a conversation Prayer enables us to share with him every aspect of our lives and to rest confidently in his embrace This meditation helped to confirm a new monthly Young Adult gathering ages 1840 that we will be starting here in December More information to follow in next weeks bulletin This coming weekend we will host a special edition of our monthly discussion forum entitled News from Rome Youve most likely heard of the Amazon Synod in the media cycle over the past few weeks Also you may have seen that last week started the ad limina visits of the United States bishops to the Holy Father the first such visit during Pope Francis pontificate These visits will continue throughout February and is a chance for the bishops to share with the Holy Father reports on their dioceses Bishop Rhoades will be meeting with the Holy Father the second week of December to share the good work occurring in our own diocese For this discussion forum I will provide some insights into the working docu ments of the Amazon Synod speak on what exactly a local synod is share a bit about the structure of the ad limina visits and even share a few photos from my recent pilgrimage in Rome We will offer the discussion forum on both Sunday November 17th between Masses 840945 AM and Wednesday November 20th after the evening Mass 730830 PM All are welcome to join us and participate in our discussion Faithfully in Christ Fr David WEEKEND OF NOVEMBER 2324 2019 CANTORS 500 Jay
