February 11 2024 This weekend February 10th 11th the Church celebrates the Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time This will be our last weekend in Ordinary Time for over three months as we prepare to enter the Lenten season It will only be after the forty days of Lent the fifty days of Easter and Pentecost that we once again return to Ordinary Time We will then spend the rest of the liturgical year in Ordinary Time unpacking the mysteries we've just gone through The Lenten season will begin this Wednesday February 14th as we enter into the celebration of Ash Wednesday We will offer three Mass times for Ash Wednesday 7:00AM Noon and 7:00PM This annual entrance into Lent serves as a time of recollection and penance preparing for the greatest of all celebrations Easter Sunday By walking with the Lord through His own forty days in the desert so we prepare ourselves to walk with Him to heaven An important part of our Lenten observance is found in the practices of fasting and abstinence from meat both on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday When fasting a person eats one full meal and two smaller meals that together do not equal a full meal The norms on fasting are obligatory from age 18 until age 59 The norms concerning abstinence from meat are binding from age 14 onwards All Fridays during Lent are also days of abstinence from meat In addition to fasting from food we also find forms of fasting reflected in our liturgy Starting on Ash Wednesday we fast from both praying the Gloria and singing the Alleluia These two liturgical elements joyously praising God will not pass our lips again until the Easter Vigil when we rejoice together in the resurrection Their absences from our Mass are meant to highlight the truly penitential nature of these forty days Similarly we will continue the practice begun last year of concluding our Masses during Lent with a silent recessional following the St Michael Prayer This practice encouraged by our national bishops conference offers us the opportunity for periods of deeper reflection and prayer As explained by the conference Silence allows the community to reflect on what it has heard and experienced and to open its heart to the mystery celebrated We also undergo a visual fast during Lent as many of the adornments in the Church are simplified or removed The sanctuary becomes a bit more bare with less floral decorations present The gilded crucifix golden candlesticks and bleached candles are taken away and replaced with a wooden crucifix wooden candlesticks and unbleached candles Eventually even our devotional statuary is itself veiled as our eyes focus on the Lord alone Lenten Opportunity Eucharistic Small Groups Following our sign ups over this past month we have had four groups volunteer to help lead small groups throughout Lent These groups will show the Jesus and the Eucharist series prepared this year by our national bishops conference as a part of the National Eucharistic Revival This series will run throughout the seven weeks of Lent as a way to help us each prepare for the coming Easter season Each weekly session is two hours and utilizes a beautiful combination of informative videos small group discussion and time for personal reflection Please see the sign up sheet in the narthex detailing when each group will meet and sign up for which group you plan to attend special Thank You to our group hosts for helping to lead this initiative for our parish family Sound System Update As you may have noticed over the past few weekends we have been having an issue with our sound system There are two wireless microphones which the presider can use both of which have been going in and out Earlier this week we placed a service call with local Stylus Technologies who had installed our system a number of years ago Thankfully they were able to quickly identify and remedy the problem Both microphones should now work with no issues PARISH CALENDAR Sat Feb 10St Joseph Women's Group 3rd
