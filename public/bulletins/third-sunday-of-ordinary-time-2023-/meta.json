Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time Dt 1815 20 Ps 951 2 6 9 1 Cor 732 35 Mk 121 28 Third Sunday in Ordinary Time January 21 2024 This weekend Jan 20th 21st the Church celebrates the Third Sunday in Ordinary Time Having heard the call of St Peter from the Gospel of St John now we hear it from the Gospel of St Mark We will remain in the Gospel of St Mark until mid way through the Lenten season when we again hear from the Gospel of St John This interweaving between the two Gospels highlights the brevity of St Mark's being the shortest of the four Gospels In addition to being the shortest Gospel St Mark's is often seen as the most urgent In it Jesus is often described as rushing about St Mark actually makes use of the Greek word or immediately 41 different times We hear it in our Gospel today as the Apostles immediately left their boats and nets to follow after Jesus Likewise we will soon hear of how lepers are healed in an instant and the sick leap to their feet when touched by the Lord The theme of urgency was understood since the beginnings of the Church to point to one of the main sources for St Mark's Gospel St Peter Scripturally we know that St Mark was very close with St Peter having been with him in Rome and called by him my son Mark 1 Peter 513 Traditionally the early Church Fathers reconfirm this belief For example St Justin Martyr writing in AD 155 refers to St Mark's Gospel as the memoirs of Peter This close relationship with St Peter explains how St Mark would have known intimate details about the life of the Lord Papia of Hierapolis a first century bishop and disciple of St John the Apostle wrote When Mark be came Peter's interpreter he wrote down accurately although not in order all that he remembered of what was said or done by the Lord For Mark had not heard the Lord nor followed Him but later as I have said followed Peter In other words St Mark's Gospel contains much of the preaching and memories that St Peter shared with him This helps to explain how the text itself is seemingly from St Peter's point of view More than the other Gospels St Mark is a witness to the rebukes and failings of St Peter This account comes directly from the mouth of a man still stung by his earlier denials witnessing against himself as he now gives his all to proclaim Jesus Christ Ash Wednesday and the Start of Lent Given how early Easter falls this year the start of Lent is less than a month away It is never too early to begin our preparations for Ash Wednesday and the Lenten season As a part of this preparation starting this weekend there is a basket in the narthex to collect old palms These palms will be burned and the resulting ashes used for the imposition of ashes on Ash Wednesday For your planning purposes Ash Wednesday falls on Wednesday Feb 14th this year and we will offer Masses on Ash Wednesday Feb 14th at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM As a reminder Ash Wednesday is a day of fasting and abstinence Abstinence refers to those from age 14 onward refraining from meat Fasting refers to those from age 18 until age 59 eating only one full meal and two smaller meals that together are not equal to a full meal Building the Domestic Church Kiosk These past many years we've had a kiosk with Lighthouse Catholic Media CDs available in the narthex Following the national trend of moving towards digital media we've seen that these CDs are no longer being taken as often as they had in the past Given the limited space in the narthex we've decided to discontinue the use of this CD kiosk moving forward The remaining CDs will be available for the taking on the table in the narthex Thanks to a generous donation by our Knights of Columbus we will be replacing the CD kiosk with a kiosk from Catholic Information Services CIS This new kiosk offers a variety of booklets that are a part of the CIS's Building the Domestic Church series This series seeks to help strengthen the domestic church which is our families by providing engaging faith based literature free of cost Make sure to take a look at the new kiosk soon In Christ Fr David PARISH CALENDAR Sat Jan 20 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sun Jan 21 Mass 7:30am Mass 10:00am Sun Jan
