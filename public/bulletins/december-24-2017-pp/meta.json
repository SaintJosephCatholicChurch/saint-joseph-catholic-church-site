consider seriously of joining us to the home land of Jesus Christ our Redeemer and Mes siah You will never regret going It will help you to understand more vividly the Scripture passages It is from April 23 to May 2 2018 In the first reading 2 Sam 715 6b12 14a16 David full of good will wanted to build a houseChurchTemple for God but instead God promised and built a kingdom for him You see in a desire to give God God gives us It is in giving gifts to God that we receive gifts from him It is in preparing for Gods coming that God will prepare a place for us Listen Christmas is such an important event to come Celebrate it very well Thus St Paul tells us in the second reading Rm 162527 that In Christmas in Christ God revealed the mystery He kept secret for ages past for a long time ago In our time he has revealed it in Christ He gave us the image of himself in his Son Christ Jesus an image we can perceive with our weak human senses Christmas is a yearly momentous event for those who are expecting the Emmanuel God is with us in faith and wonderment Then in the Gospel Lk 12638 just read the angel Gabriel which means the Strength of God was sent by God to Galilee and he greeted Virgin Mary The greet ing disturbed her because the work Hail is an attribute of divinity She was given the most difficult message ever given to a human person Behold you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you shall name him Jesus Mary said to the angel How can this be since I have no relations with a man The angel assured her that God will take care of everything She trusted God and accepted the impossible task and the impossible became possible She said Let it be done to me according to your word Mary consented And immediate conception took place in her womb By trust ing in God she said Yes to God This yes the Church is asking us to say to God in our lives It is a million yes a billion yes and a trillium yes As Mary welcomed the son of God Jesus Christ in her womb so too let us welcome him in our hearts Hearts free from sin free from hatred jealousy calumny Gossip but hearts full of love kindness forgiveness Let us also welcome him in our midst in our homes and in our community The Yes of Our Lady Mary in the Gospel fulfilled the promise God made to our ancestors and to us through David that his own flesh will be the heir who will take seat and sit on his throne and that his kingdom will have no end Let us my dear brothers and sisters in Christ say yes to God in all things in our lives as Mary did God bless you Fr Pius Ilechukwu NB Heaven is for us all I hope
