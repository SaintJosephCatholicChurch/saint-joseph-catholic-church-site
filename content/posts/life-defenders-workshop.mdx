<p style="text-align: justify;">Many people today reject or are indifferent to the pro-life view, often because they&rsquo;ve never heard the pro-life position presented in a compelling manner. Life Defenders will prepare you to confidently communicate the pro-life position to others. Using science &amp; philosophy, you will learn to simplify the debate. Come learn to speak intelligently and graciously to the most pressing moral issue of our time: abortion. You&rsquo;ll leave prepared to confidently persuade others by exposing the logical fallacies of abortion-choice rhetoric without the need for vitriol and angry dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Workshop is open to Students (7th Grade and Older) and Adults</strong><br>Cost is $5 per Person | Coffee and Donuts Provided</p>
