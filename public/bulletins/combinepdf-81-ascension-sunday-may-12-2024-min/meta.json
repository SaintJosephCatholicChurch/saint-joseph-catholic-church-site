Ascension of the Lord May 12 2024 This weekend May 11th 12th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord Throughout most of the world this celebration fell this past Thursday to mark forty days after Easter Sunday In our diocese and most of the United States however this solemnity is moved to the nearest Sunday to allow as many of the Faithful as possible to celebrate this great event of the Paschal Mystery In the Ascension of the Lord the Church realizes that her true home is heaven Philippians 320 21 The Lord's departure is not to be seen as an ending but truly as a beginning As the Apostles gaze heavenward they do so with hearts full of anticipation for the promised coming of the Holy Spirit John 1415 31 This is a pivotal moment preparing for the foundation of the Church at Pentecost The nine days between the Ascension and Pentecost is truly a novena as the Apostles prayerfully prepare for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit May we imitate their example and spend these days until Pentecost prayerfully opening our hearts to receive and accept the gift of the Holy Spirit into our lives today The Holy Spirit will lead us until we too will be taken up in the clouds to meet Christ and be with our Lord forever 1 Thessalonians 416 In addition to the Solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord we as a nation also celebrate Mother's Day this weekend We wish a Happy Mother's Day to our mothers grandmothers godmothers and all women who have acted as mothers to us throughout our lives In the words of St Teresa of Calcutta How grateful we must be to God for this wonderful gift of motherhood that brings such joy to the whole world After Masses this weekend we have a special gift of carnations to give to the women of our parish as a sign of our love and gratitude for you Thank you for your presence in our lives and for how you live out in your own God given way the great gift of motherhood in your lives These carnations also serve to support women throughout our entire area coming from a fundraiser for the Northeast Indiana Right to Life that our parish helps to support Parish Council Nominations On May 1st we held our last Parish Council meeting for the year before our summer break I wish to give a special Thank You to our entire Parish Council and in a special way to Abraham Herr and Andy Vachon who have now completed their three year term on the Parish Council As the Parish Council serves as an advisory committee to the pastor each member serves a three year term to help ensure we hear from a wide variety of voices With their terms completed we are now accepting nominations for the two open seats on the Parish Council Please see this weekend's bulletin insert for more information about the Parish Council and what is asked of those who sit on the Parish Council I encourage you to spend time prayerfully discerning whether or not you are called to nominate yourself or another parishioner Nominations will close at the end of June After nominations are made I will confirm that those nominated accept the nominations Afterwards two names will be drawn at random Acts 126 Our Parish Council meetings will resume in August As we will be entering our 150th Parish Anniversary 1875 2025 I will be relying heavily on our Parish Council this coming year to help in the planning of our sesquicentennial Pentecost Seminarian Collection Next weekend is one of only two second collections that we take up at the request of the diocese throughout the year Our annual Pentecost Seminarian Collection envelope helps to provide for the education of our future priests On behalf of our seminarians Thank You for your generosity and for your continued prayers for our future priests It is my prayer that this collection will one day soon serve to aid future seminarians from our own parish In Christ Fr David PARISH CALENDAR Sat May 11 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sun May 12 Mass 7:30am Mass 10:00am Tues May 14 Adoration 7
