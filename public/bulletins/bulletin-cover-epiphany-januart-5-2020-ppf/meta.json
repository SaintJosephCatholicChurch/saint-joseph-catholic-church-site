Lord This celebration falls on the 12th Day of Christmas and commemorates three different events of Salvation History The visitation of the Magi to the Christ Child Matthew 2112 the Baptism of the Lord Matthew 313 17 and the Wedding Feast at Cana John 2111 Each of these events signify an epiphany or manifestation of the second person of the Trinity to the world In the adoration of the Magi Jesus is revealed as Savior to the Gentiles in His Baptism Jesus is revealed as Gods beloved Son by the voice from heaven at the miracle in Cana Jesus reveals His glory and begins His public ministry For those who attended the Saturday vigil Mass this weekend we will have heard our choir proclaim the Announcement of Easter and the Moveable Feasts after the proclamation of the Gospel This announcement proclaims the major feast days of the Churchs liturgical calendar for the remainder of the liturgical year while emphasizing the unity and integrity of the Paschal Mystery Even though we stretch that mystery across an en tire liturgical calendar we must not mentally separate the Christ Child from Christ crucified Therefore the Church finds it fitting on this day this feast of the manifestation of Christ to the world to proclaim to the world the major events of Christs saving mystery As has become our parish tradition Epiphany Chalk will be blessed and available in the narthex after every Mass this weekend You are invited and encouraged to make use of this sacramental to bless your home for the New Year Through this prayer we are inviting God into our homes and placing our families under His constant protection Please see the prayer sheet included with the Epiphany Chalk for instructions and the bulletin insert for more information regarding this wonderful tradition Upcoming Parish Events This coming Thursday Jan 9th our Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults RCIA Program will be offering a Teaching Mass This will be an opportunity for a detailed walkthrough and discussion of the various parts of the Mass from the vesting prayers prayed by the priest prior to Mass to the final blessing at the end of Mass This is an open event and all are invited to attend If youve desired to gain a deeper understanding of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass or have any questions regarding the liturgy this would be the perfect event to attend The Teaching Mass meet this Thursday January 9th from 530630 PM in the Church Note To allow for the walkthrough and questions this is not an actual Mass Our daily Mass on Thursday will be at 8 AM Also this Thursday we begin our four week book study over our Christmas book Jimmy Akins The Bible is a Catholic Book We will meet the next four Thursdays January 9th 16th 23rd and 30th in the Parish Conference Room from 700 8:00PM
