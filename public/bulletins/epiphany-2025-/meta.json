weekend January 4th 5th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord This celebration is meant to mark the twelfth day of Christmastide and celebrates the Magi seeking out the newborn King of the Jews Matthew 22 With the arrival of the Shepherds Luke 1616 21 and now the Magi Jew and Gentile alike have sought out and encountered the Messiah cf Ephesians 214 22 With the arrival of the Shepherds the Christ child's humanity as the Word made Flesh was recognized In the Epiphany Jesus Divinity is proclaimed For this reason the Epiphany is traditionally associated with three different scriptural events 1 The Arrival of the Magi 2 The Baptism of the Lord and 3 The Wedding Feast of Cana In each of these moments Jesus Divinity is in some way revealed or manifested to the world As has become our parish tradition we will bless and pass out Epiphany Chalk after all Masses this weekend Included with the Epiphany Chalk are holy water and instructions in how we can use the chalk and holy water to bless our homes in this new year This sacramental act itself serves as another form of manifestation of Jesus to the world as we publicly invite the Lord to dwell within our homes and sanctify our daily lives What's In Name IHS JHS This past Friday the Church celebrated the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus This celebration references the scriptural account of Jesus receiving His name eight days after His birth Luke 221 It also finds roots within the writings of St Paul who proclaims that God the Father gave Jesus that name which is above every name Philippians 29 This name is of course Jesus or in Hebrew Yeshua which means God saves Devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus is often reflected through the use of the Christogram or the letters IHS Found in use as early as the third century IHS serves as an abbreviation of the Greek spelling of the Lord's name This is why you will occasionally see these three letters or JHS as a Latin variation on vestments altar cloths or liturgical artwork They serve as a reminder of the power of Jesus name Teaching Mass Thursday Jan 16th at 6:30PM Join us on Thursday Jan 16th at 6:30PM in the Church for a Teaching Mass Though not an actual Mass this event is a walk through of the liturgy itself that highlights and explores the rich meaning behind the various elements both prayers and items of the Mass This special event offers us an opportunity to deepen our understanding and appreciation of the Mass All are welcome come with questions and an open heart If you know of anyone outside of our parish who may be interested in learning about the Catholic Mass please invite them to join us as well In the words of Scott Hahn The liturgy is where heaven and earth meet and we encounter the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world There is no more beautiful experience to introduce someone to the Faith then Mass itself Great Catholic Thinkers The Hound of Heaven Starting on Monday January 13th at 6:30PM in the Parish Conference Room we will be offering Great Catholic Thinkers every other Monday over the next several months This series will look at various short stories and poems from a variety of Catholic authors At our first meeting on Jan 13th we will look at Francis Thompson's The Hound of Heaven This poem offers a profound illustration of Gods relentless love and pursuit of the human soul Please see the sign up sheet in the narthex to join our mailing list for this series Each gathering will be independent of one another meaning you are welcome to attend any andor all of the series as your schedule allows Given the nature of the short works I will forward a PDF of each reading to those who have signed up prior to each session Faithfully in Christ Fr David Weekend of
