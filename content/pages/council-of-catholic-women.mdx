<h2>PRAYER TO OUR LADY OF GOOD COUNSEL</h2>
<div>God of heavenly wisdom, you have given us Mary, Mother of Jesus, to be our guide and counselor.&nbsp; Grant that we may always seek her motherly help in this life and so enjoy her blessed presence in the life to come.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>O Mother of Good Counsel, patroness of the National Council of Catholic Women, intercede for us, that we may be wise, courageous and loving leaders of the Church.&nbsp; Help us, dear mother, to know the mind of Jesus, your son. May the Holy Spirit fill us with reverence for God&rsquo;s creation, and compassion for all God&rsquo;s children. May our labors of love on earth enhance the reign of God and may God&rsquo;s gifts of faith and living hope prepare us for the fullness of the world to come. Amen.</div>
