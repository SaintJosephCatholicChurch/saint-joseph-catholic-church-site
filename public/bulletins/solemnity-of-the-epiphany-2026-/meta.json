Epiphany of the Lord January 4 2026 Happy New Year This weekend January 3rd 4th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord Following the Christmas Octave we move from the intimate setting of the creche to the wide horizon of the world What was first revealed quietly to Mary and Joseph and exalted to the shepherds in the field is now made manifest to all nations The very word epiphany originally meant manifestation or to be made known In the visit of the Magi we find the fulfillment of God's promise Christ is willing to go out to the furthest corners of the earth for every heart that seeks Him The Magi guided by a star and coming from afar remind us that faith is always a journey It is a journey that only finds its fulfillment in true worship which begins when we like the Magi are willing to place our gifts our lives and our very selves before the King who has come to save us Having encountered Christ the Magi do not return home the same way they came They departed for their country by another way An epiphany always demands a response From the Magi and also now from us We are invited this week to seek Christ intentionally through prayer and to go forth by making His presence known through acts of charity words of faith and extending invitations to those who are searching for the King Teaching Mass Thursday Jan 8th at 6:30PM Join us on Thursday Jan 8th at 6:30PM in the Parish Social Hall for a Teaching Mass Though not an actual Mass this event is a walk through of the liturgy itself that highlights and explores the rich meaning behind the various elements both prayers and liturgical items used throughout the Mass This special event offers an opportunity to deepen both our understanding and appreciation of the Mass If you know of anyone who may be interested in learning more about the Catholic Mass please invite them to join us as well In the words of Scott Hahn The liturgy is where heaven and earth meet and we encounter the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world There is no more beautiful experience to introduce someone to the Faith then the Mass itself All are welcome come with questions and an open heart Diocese Synod Opening Prayer and Parish Involvement Prior to our parish gathering for the Diocesan Synod we will begin in the way the Church has always begun moments of discernment In prayer In preparation for the Synod we will pray the Synodal Prayer before the final blessing at all Masses beginning the weekend of Jan 24th 25th This moment of communal prayer will lead us into our Opening Prayer Session for the Synod on Monday January 26th at 6:00PM in the Parish Social Hall At our Opening Prayer Session we will gather for the Mass the greatest prayer that the Church can offer together In the homily I hope to share with you both what exactly a Synod is and my own experiences from participating in the Synod session for priests this past October Following our Opening Prayer Session we will share the Synodal Prayerbook with all attendees so that they might prayerful prepare to participate in our Synod session On Monday February 9th from 600 8:00PM we will host our Synod session in the Parish Gym
