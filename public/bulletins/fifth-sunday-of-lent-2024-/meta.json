17th the Church celebrates the Fifth Sunday of Lent commonly referred to as Passiontide As is our parish custom we have veiled our statuary and crucifixes in purple cloth starting this weekend These coverings will remain present save for the crucifix in the sanctuary until the beginning of the Easter Vigil Why is this done In veiling our devotional items we are visibly reminded that we are in a special time It's one of the many changes we see come about during the Lenten season Upon entering the Church itself we immediately see that something is different These last two weeks of Lent are meant to prepare us for the coming Sacred Paschal Triduum This practice offers us a blunt visual reminder that we are to being preparing our hearts for the Lord One of the ways that we can prepare our hearts is by focusing on the words and readings of the Mass in these coming days Next weekend we will hear the Passion narrative read as the Gospel and are called to focus our minds on these sacred words In veiling our statuary we restrict a portion of our senses so that we might heighten the others and focus on what we are hearing As we hear these words more intently they are meant to produce in our hearts an intensified sense of anticipation for Easter How much more exciting will it be then when we enter the Church at Easter and see the statuary and crucifixes unveiled Just as wrapping paper covers a gift that we want to unwrap so these veils cover beautiful images that we want to see Just like wrapping paper on a present these veils are not meant to be there forever They are only temporary waiting to be removed and show forth the great gifts that have been given In this way our statuary and crucifixes will soon be uncovered in their beauty and glory at Easter so that we can bask in the true gift to which they all point The light of the Risen Lord Parish Penance Service This coming Wednesday March 20th from 600 7:00PM I will be joined by four other priests for our Lenten Parish Penance Service This opportunity with additional confessors offered in addition to our weekly confession times is but another way we can prepare our hearts for the coming joy of Easter I encourage you if you haven't yet had an opportunity to make use of this truly wondrous Sacrament this Lenten season join us for our penance service on Wednesday In this great Sacrament of Confession we hear the voice of the Savior Himself as our sins are forgiven and we receive the great gift of God's mercy Even if it has been a long time come and experience His mercy anew Palm Sunday Procession Next weekend we will have the blessing of palms at all Masses as a part of our Palm Sunday liturgies At the 10 AM Sunday Mass we will begin our celebration with a procession from outside the Church This procession helps to lead us into Holy Week as we join with the crowds welcoming Christ into Jerusalem In the same way we continue this journey all the way to the Sacred Paschal Triduum to the joy of Easter Sunday and beyond St Joseph's Day This week the Church celebrates both the feast days of St Patrick Sunday and St Joseph Tuesday As St Joseph is our parish patron we continue our annual celebration of the St Joseph Table at Masses throughout this weekend For this reason our new St Joseph statue is the only statue that will remain unveiled this weekend though he will be veiled after the feast day on Tuesday As part of our St Joseph Table you are invited to take with you a sweet from the table after Mass special Thank You to those who helped arrange for this yearly treat There is a free will donation basket on the table which will be donated to support activities and events for our Youth Group PARISH CALENDAR Sat Mar 16 Confession 4 4:45pm Mass 5:00pm Sun Mar 17 Mass 7:30am
