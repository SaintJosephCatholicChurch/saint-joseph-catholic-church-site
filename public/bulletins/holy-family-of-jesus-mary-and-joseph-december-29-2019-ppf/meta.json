FAMILY OF JESUS MARY AND JOSEPH December 29 2019 As a reminder the Solemnity of Mary Mother of God is a Holy Day of Obligation celebrated this Wednesday January 1st Having just celebrated the Nativity of our Lord this celebration honoring Jesus mother falls on the octave or eighth day of Christmas With its roots in the 5th Century Council of Ephesus declaration of the Blessed Mother as Theotokos or Godbearer this Solemnity asserts the divinity of Jesus Christ As St Athanasius wrote in veneration To venerate To give great respect of the Blessed Mother in the 4th Century You are the Mother of God and our Queen Help us for the sake of the King the Lord God Master Who was born of you For this reason you are called full of Grace Mass Times Solemnity of Mary Mother of God Tuesday December 31 Vigil Mass at 5:00PM Wednesday January 1 Masses at 7:30AM and 10 AM We will welcome Fr Nathan Maskal associate pastor of St Pius in Granger as the celebrant for our Holy Day Masses Fr Maskals family are parishioners of St Charles Borromeo in Fort Wayne and he will be in the area visiting for the New Year Fr Maskal is also a Fort Wayne Komets superfan and will be attending the New Years Eve game at the Coliseum In turn I will be offering Masses for the Solemnity at St Pius my home parish for Fr Maskal while also taking the opportunity to visit with my family in the South Bendarea I look forward to seeing you in the new year this coming weekend This weekend we are not only preparing for the New Year but are also celebrating the beautiful Feast of the Holy Family of Jesus Mary and Joseph as we continue in the Christmas season On this Feast Day we are reminded that Jesus took on flesh and entered into family life Cradled in the arms of the Blessed Mother and under the watchful and protective gaze of St Joseph In this way our Lord reminds each and everyone of us that family life is where we first learn to love It is here where we first feel the love of God experienced through the love of our mother and father It is here that our hearts first experience that yearning for love Himself God This does not mean that family life is one that suffers no trials Quite the opposite As we know through experience there are often many Calvaries we must pass through out of love for our families It is for this reason that this Feast Day is of such great importance The human family has many trials so Jesus sanctified them by living in a family Venerable Fulton Sheen Every aspect of our lives including our family life can and must be given over to God Every joy and happiness Every trial and struggle In doing so we gain the strength to move forward and experience the love that we have been seeking out our entire lives Faithfully in Christ Fr David special Thank You and my eternal gratitude to all of those who helped to ensure our Christmas Liturgies went so well Our church is beautifully decorated thanks to the dedicated work of our Decorating Committee Sr Rose and our Choir
