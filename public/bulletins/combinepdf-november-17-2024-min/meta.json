Thirty Third Sunday in Ordinary Time November 17 2024 This weekend November 16th 17th the Church celebrates the Thirty third Sunday in Ordinary Time Next weekend the Thirty fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time is actually celebrated as the Solemnity of Jesus Christ King of the Universe brings our liturgical year to a close Given this proximity to the end of the year our readings today directly focus on the passage of time and the fleeting nature of all creation Though our readings have an apocalyptic flair this weekend our Gospel does remind us of the Lord's words that of that day or hour no one knows These readings at the end of the liturgical year are meant more so for us so that we might focus not on the end of time itself but on our own mortality The Church gives us these last weeks of the liturgical year precisely for self reflection which may lead to a healthy use of the Sacrament of Reconciliation On Tuesday I will join with the other members of our Presbyterial Council for our quarterly meeting with Bishop Rhoades The Bishop will share with us from his experiences of attending the Synod of Bishops in Rome this past month In preparation for our meeting he has asked us to read the closing document from the Synod For a Synodal Church For those interested I have made the document available on our parish website for you to read as well Forty Hours Devotion In the Sacred Scriptures the only time that our Lord asked His Apostles for anything was when He pleaded with them to watch with Him for just one hour cf Matthew 2640 45 This plea continues even unto our own day One way we can respond to this cry is through our upcoming Forty Hours Devotion from Monday Dec 2nd to Wednesday Dec 4th In these forty hours we offer the Lord a sacrifice of one hour of our time to be spent with Him in adoration I encourage each of us to give of our time and sign up for an hour of adoration with the Lord We have already had a wonderful response but still have a number of hours to fill I know how difficult this can be especially as our Forty Hours is scheduled throughout the week Yet part of this devotion means recognizing that as busy as we might be we truly need God in our day Church Heating System Earlier last month our boilers were serviced for the coming winter Given the erratic temperatures over the past several weeks however we delayed turning on our heating system until this weekend As I mention each year our boilers have two settings for heating the Church On and Off As of Thursday of this week we have opened the boilers and the system is On for the winter Liturgy of the Eucharist Reception of Holy Communion Following the Eucharistic Prayer the other pinnacle moment in the Liturgy of the Eucharist would be our reception of Holy Communion The word communion comes from the Latin word communio meaning sharing and strengthening In the reception of Holy Communion we are united with the person of Jesus Christ to share in the divine life of the Trinity and be strengthened through this relationship In the Holy Eucharist we truly become united with the person of Christ St Cyril the fourth century Bishop of Jerusalem gives us this analogy Just as by melting two candles together you get one piece of wax so one who're ceives the flesh and blood of Jesus is fused together with Him and the soul finds that he is in Christ and Christ is in him As we are uniquely united to Christ we are now called to live out His life through our own When we receive Holy Communion we respond to the proclamation The Body of Christ with Amen This Amen comes from an Aramaic word meaning I believe At that moment our Amen becomes a testimony to our Faith in the Holy Eucharist stating I truly believe that when I receive the Holy Eucharist it is Jesus Christ whom I am receiving And in receiving Him we are then sent out as members of His Body the Church to evangelize ORG Our Parish Code 7N68MY Weekend of November 23rd 24th 500 Dan Lautzenheiser 730 Donna Geisel
