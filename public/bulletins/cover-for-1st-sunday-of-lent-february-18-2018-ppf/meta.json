EVIL WITH THE SPIRIT OF REPEN TANCE PRAYER FASTING AND ALMSGIVING My dear brothers and sisters in the Lord peace be with you all Today is the first Sunday of lent Lent is a period we are called to climb the mountain of repentance pen ance prayer and love These will help us to climb the mountain of Easter Resurrection It is a period we are called to a life of Gospel conversion fasting praying almsgiving mutual forgiveness change of heart It is a call to confess our sins It is a call to love of God and love of our neighbors and even our enemies It is a call to a life of holiness to believe in the mystery of the redemptive act of Jesus as our Redeemer our Liberator and our Savior Lent runs from Ash Wednesday until the Mass of the Lords Supper on Holy Thursday Alleluia is not sung or said from the beginning of Lent until the Easter Vigil In the Catholic Tradition we have periods such as Retreat Parish Mission monthly recollection and a day of prayer Lenten period is like any of these So it is a period of getting off for a while and standing away from life to take a realistic look at ourselves and ask ourselves these questions Who am I Where is God in my life Why am I here on earth You can ask more such question and reflect on them Lenten season will help us to focus our attention on the real thing and prepare for the feast of our redemption Easter You need to put aside some extra time and practice and exercise some of the suggested Lenten challenges and meditatively read your Bi ble I will now speak on the flood in the first Reading Christs suffering for our sins and his temptation in the gospel Thus In the first reading Gen 9 815 the flood was seen by the ancient people as caused by the devil evil spirit or wicked angels In it they saw the power of evil and sin But if people were faithful to Gods covenant they could overcome the power of evil with Gods help The appearance of rainbow is a beautiful allegory containing a very meaningful and universal lesson God will preserve the universe if you and I coop erate Ecology is a Christian concern If we use the resources of the <a href=\"pla.net\">pla.net</a> responsibly and not wasting them we will overcome the evil of destruction St Peter in the 2nd Reading 1Pt 31822 assured us that the Lord Jesus has already saved us and overcame the power of the evil one the Devil Satan and Demon So we have been saved through Baptism by water and the Holy Spirit As Noah and his group were saved from the flood we are saved from the river of sin by baptism In the Gospel Mk 11215 Jesus went into the desert for 40 days and 40 nights to prepare himself for the work of redemption He was tempted by the devil like any of us but He did not sin He was toughened by the devils temptation You see tempta tions make us stronger Let us follow the Lord Jesus into the desert of our souls to pre pare ourselves for the journey to eternity Special Assignment for Children and young people My dear children listen for your assignment in this Lent 1 At the back of the Church take one sheets of paper entitled Lenten challenges and ask your parents to help you choose one or two things you can do 2 Tell your parents two times every week in Lent that all of you should pray together At the end of Lent you will tell me how you did this assign ment My dear brothers and sisters in Christ tie the belt of your long pants firmly around your waste at the beginning of this Lent for if you tie it loosely you will be like a per son who in the morning loosely tie hisher long pant by evening the long pant will be at your toes down the ankles The belt I am talking of is the belt of Prayer Fasting Almsgiving Love and Forgiveness God bless you Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu NB 1 Remember that our Parish Mission Week is from
