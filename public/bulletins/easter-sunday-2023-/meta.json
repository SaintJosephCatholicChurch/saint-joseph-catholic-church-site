  "text": "Easter Sunday of the Resurrection of the Lord April 9 2023 Christ is risen Truly He is risen Alleluia Alleluia Whether this is your first time visiting with us or if you are a life long parishioner we rejoice to celebrate Easter together with you On this great solemnity we rejoice in the glory of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ Death is no longer the end for us but life has now won the victory over the grave The crucifixion of Jesus Christ was not the end of His story which means that death will not be the end of our story Celebrating Easter is of such great importance because Jesus Christ has promised that we would share in His victory over sin and death through everlasting life with Him in Heaven As such Easter is not just an event to be remembered but a reality to continue living everyday of our lives That is why our Easter celebration continues for the rest of the week within the Octave of Easter or the eight days following Easter Sunday in which the joy of Christ's Resurrection echoes anew each day The full Easter season or Eastertide continues for fifty days representing how our Lord remained on earth for fifty days before His ascension into Heaven Throughout these fifty days our Lord appears to His disciples and gives to them the commission to evangelize every corner of the earth We will hear the Church's response to this commission throughout Eastertide with readings from the Acts of the Apostles This commission continues even to this day and for this reason these fifty days of Easter joy should be lived out as a way of continuing to spread the joy of Jesus Christ Congratulations are in order to Vanessa who was baptized at the Easter Vigil and Abby and Alexandria who were received into the Church through their profession of faith We are overjoyed to welcome you now to the banquet of the Eucharist We extend thanks as well to their sponsors and Jill our catechist who worked so diligently to prepare them for this day There are also so many to thank for their assistance over this past week Our Choir and Children's Choir under Teresa's direction who spent so much time rehearsing and elevating our hearts to the Lord in music Our Decorating Committee who made our church look so beautiful Our servers under the direction of Dan our Master of Ceremonies and our Lectors and Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion And Michelle Teresa and Stacey in our Parish Staff And of course to all of you who joined us in prayer throughout these most sacred days Next weekend we will welcome Fr Dave Ruppert pastor of St Mary of the Assumption in Decatur as the celebrant of our Saturday Vigil Mass I will be away for the day at St Mary's in Bluffton OH to celebrate the wedding Mass of two of our parishioners Stephen Vanderkolk and Becca Schlumbohm Please keep the happy couple in your prayers as they approach this wonderful Sacrament together This is the first of four weddings for our parish this year Parish Easter Gift Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist As we continue to prepare for the upcoming national Eucharistic Revival our parish Easter gift this year is Dr Brant Pitre's Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist Unlocking the Secrets of the Last Supper Dr Pitre looks at the celebration of the Last Supper through the lenses of both Sacred Scripture and ancient Judaism This allows him to explore ancient Jewish beliefs about the Passover of the Messiah the miraculous Manna from heaven and the mysterious Bread of the Presence As Dr Pitre shows these three keys the Passover the Manna and the Bread of the Presence have the power to unlock the original meaning of the Eucharistic words of Jesus Along the way Dr Pitre also explains how Jesus united the Last Supper to his death on Good Friday and his Resurrection on Easter Sunday During this Easter season this gift is sure to illuminate one of the greatest mysteries of the Christian faith the mystery of Jesus presence in the breaking of the bread MASS INTENTIONS Holy Saturday April 8 8:00am Lauds Morning Prayer 830 10:00am Confession 9:00pm Easter Vigil in the Holy Night Greg Mayer Sunday April 9 Easter Sunday 7:10am Rosary 7:30am
