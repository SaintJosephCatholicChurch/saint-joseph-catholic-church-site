  "text": "IFTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME EBRUARY 7 2021 As the Church celebrates the Fifth Sunday of Ordinary Time this weekend February 6th 7th we draw even closer to the beginning of our Lenten season Prior to Pope St Paul VIs primary revision of the liturgical calendar in 1969 the three weekends leading up to Ash Wednesday were known as Shrovetide During this time the Faithful would begin their preparations for the coming Lenten season through serious discernment This discernment would serve to determine how to best approach Lent through our Lenten observances In these observances which are based in prayer fasting and almsgiving we strive to move closer to the Lord In the words of Venerable Fulton Sheen Lenten practices of giving up pleasures are good reminders that the purpose of life is not pleasure Instead the purpose of life is union with God And throughout Lent we are reminded that if we wish to share in the triumph of Jesus Resurrection we must first follow Him in the Way of the Cross Historically this time of discernment also included a time of celebration These celebrations such as Carnival and Mardi Gras often served two purposes one practical and one spiritual Practically these celebrations served as a time to clean the pantry of those items that would be forgone during Lent and would otherwise spoil or be wasted This of course is less of an issue with modern refrigeration and preservation techniques Spiritually they served as a reminder of what Lent points us toward the celebration of Easter and the joy of the Resurrection All the penitential practices of this life are always meant to give way to the joy of eternity Entering into this Lent we will offer three Masses for Ash Wednesday February 17th at 7 AM Noon and 7 PM As previously mentioned when you approach to receive ashes the ashes will be sprinkled over your head differing from our customary practice of having ashes imposed upon the forehead by the priests thumb This change requested by the Vatican will help to limit unnecessary contact during the ongoing pandemic Starting on Friday February 19th we will offer Stations of the Cross every Lenten Friday at 7 PM in the Church For those who cannot yet join us in person Stations will also be livestreamed at the same time via our Facebook page Following our diocesan guidelines for gatherings and after consulting with our Parish Council we will not be offering our customary Lenten Soup Supper prior to Stations at this time In addition to Stations of the Cross our weekly Confession times will continue Tuesdays at 830900 AM Wednesdays at 600645 PM Saturdays at 400445 PM Anytime by Appointment In addition to these weekly times we will be adding even more times throughout Lent to ensure that the Sacrament is as available as possible Confessions continue to be heard in the back childrens room to allow for social distancing Finally we are working to schedule a Lenten Parish Mission which will follow the same format as our past Advent Mission More information to come May we make this the best Lent ever Faithfully in Christ Fr David I will be away this week for a diocesan meeting followed by a few days of retreat There will be no daily Mass this Tuesday Feb 9th or Thursday Feb 11th Thanks to help from Fr Stephen Felicichia Confessions 6 PM and daily Mass 7 PM will continue as scheduled for Wednesday

Bolivian Mission Program was established here at St Jo sephs in 1985 For 36 years we have consistently sponsored 55 students with scholarships to attend Santa Maria Mazzarello School in Bolivia Because the parents are not always able to pay for their children to attend school these scholarships help with the cost of tuition school supplies and more Some stu dents have furthered their education by becoming profession als enabling them to help their parents financially and also give back to the poor communities they grew up in At the end of the school year the children will send letters here to St Jo sephs along with a picture of themselves to show gratitude for the opportunity to attend school because of the generous gift given to them After someone has translated the letters we send them to their respective sponsor Sadly some of our spon sors have moved or passed away leaving several openings needing to be filled If you are interested in sponsoring a child or children please call the parish office 8241380 or Sue Singer at 8248009 Their school year begins in February and concludes in October Scholarships are 90 10month for 9 months per child plus an
