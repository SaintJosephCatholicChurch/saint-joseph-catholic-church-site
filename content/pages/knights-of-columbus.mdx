<h2>WHY SHOULD YOU JOIN THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS?</h2>
<div>
<p>Becoming a Knight can transform your life. If you are interested in helping others, serving your parish, or growing in your faith, or having access to top-rated insurance protection, then the Knights of Columbus is the organization for you.</p>
<p>Charity is the first principle of the Knights of Columbus. In the past decade the Knights of Columbus have donated more than $1.4 billion and 664 million volunteer hours to worthy causes. Unity and Fraternity are the second and third principles. The Knights of Columbus was founded so that men could work together to save their parishes and communities, protect the well-being of their Catholic families, and support each other in faith and in many other ways along life&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>You are probably asking yourself &ndash; &ldquo;So if I join, what am I getting myself into?&rdquo; Here at St. Joseph&rsquo;s in Bluffton, our Council meets the first Tuesday of each month at 7:00 pm in the parish hall. Many of us arrive early to pray the Rosary at 6:45 in the Church. If it has been a long time, or if you were never taught how to pray the Rosary, we will be glad to teach you. When we started the Council, there were hardly any Knights who could have prayed the Rosary from memory. Our business meeting basically consists of the reports of the Officers and the Committee Directors dealing with whatever projects are coming up. We end each meeting with a short presentation on a topic designed to help us grow in our faith. We do keep the meeting moving, we try to be done in about an hour, and then we end with prayer. You can make of the Knights of Columbus what you want. There are dozens of activities you may choose to get involved with if you wish. For the present our Council has chosen to focus on Faith and Pro-Life. If you want to get the big picture of what the Knights of Columbus is about you may want to check out the web site at <a href="http://www.kofc.org/">www.kofc.org</a>. There you will no doubt find more information about the Knights of Columbus than you will know what to do with.</p>
<p>During the Last Supper Jesus took a towel and tied it around his waist. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet. When the Lord had finished, he said: &ldquo;I have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do.&rdquo; The Catechism of the Catholic Church says that God created us so that we could know, love, and serve Him. We serve God by serving others. This is known as charity, or love: and God is love. So, we strive to serve our Lord. That is what the Knights of Columbus are all about &ndash; Faith and Good Works. As Knights we are called to imitate Christ. Prayer is our sword, Good Works our shield. We would be very pleased if you should decide to join us in our service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Yours in Christ,</p>
<p>The Members of Council # 7555</p>
