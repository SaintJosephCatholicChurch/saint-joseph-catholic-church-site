Octave Day of Easter known as Divine Mercy Sunday The latter name was given in 2000 by Pope St John Paul II following the canonization of St Faustina a humble Polish nun to whom Jesus revealed His message of divine mercy From this message we received the beautiful Divine Mercy Chaplet to implore Gods mercy by invoking the merits of Jesus sacrifice One side of the insert in this weekend's bulletin offers a walk through of how to pray the Divine Mercy Chaplet Prayed upon the Rosary this devotion mediates upon that great gift of mercy that flowed forth upon the earth from our Lord upon the Holy Cross We do not have to be a people lost in despair and grief Instead Jesus Christ provides us a refuge and shelter from the storm and in His great mercy offers comfort and rest to all weary souls special Thank You to parishioner Nancy Wagner for painting this year's Paschal Candle In recognition of our 150th Anniversary the Paschal Candle tells the story of Catholicism in Wells County Beginning with missionary priests coming to the area on horseback we then move to the old church on Cherry Street built in 1875 At the bottom we have the original design of our current church as it looked when dedicated in 1966 The center of the Paschal Candle places both the Eucharist and the Holy Cross at the center of our parish history As was proclaimed at the Easter Vigil in the Holy Night it is by His holy and glorious wounds suffered upon the Holy Cross that we are saved And as described in Christus Dominus of the Second Vatican Council the Eucharist is the center and culmination of the whole life of the Christian community In Memory of Pope Francis Our Holy Father Pope Francis returned home to the Father this past Monday morning following an extensive illness over these past two months The Mass of Christian Burial was offered at St Peter's Basilica Saturday morning and at this time the Church has begun the Novemdiales or Nine Days of Mourning offered for Pope Francis During this time we join with the Church throughout the world in entrusting the Holy Father into the loving hands of the Saviour As a part of these Nine Days of Mourning we are offering a daily Rosary and Novena Prayers for Pope Francis every night at 6:00PM This prayer began following our Saturday Vigil Mass April 26th this weekend and will conclude next Sunday evening May 4th At this time the Church is in a period known as the Papal Interregnum This is a very unique time in the life of the Church that is often only experienced a handful of times in one's own lifetime The Papal Interregnum is the time between the resignation or death of the Holy Father and the election of a new Pope following the Papal Conclave In the narthex you will see that the picture of Pope Francis now placed in memorial at the front of the Church for the duration of the Novemdiales has been replaced with a picture of the Papal Keys and the words Sede Vacante This picture means that the Chair of St Peter the Diocese of Rome is vacant This reality is also reflected in the Eucharistic Prayer at Mass Where we would normally pray together with Francis our Pope and Kevin our bishop we now pray only together with Kevin our bishop With the election of a new pontiff at the Papal Conclave his papal name will be added to the Eucharistic Prayer As the Conclave draws near we will be offering a number of informational sessions looking at this historic event Weekend of May 3rd 4th 5:00pm TBD 7:30am TBD 10:00am TBD 5:00pm Mike Dunn 7:30am Sarah McCorkle 10:00am Ellie Coyne 5:00pm Laurisa Roper 7:30am Dale McCorkle
