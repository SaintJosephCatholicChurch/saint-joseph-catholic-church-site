  "text": "WELFTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME June 21 2020 We wish a Happy Fathers Day to all the fathers of our parish Whether you are the father of a child a grandfather a godfather an adoptive father a spiritual father we thank you for your vocation of fatherhood Know that you remain in our prayers as we ask the Lord through the intercession of St Joseph to give you wisdom fidelity joy and outpouring of His strength and courage Your witness of sacrificial love helps each of us grow deeper in our relationship with Jesus Christ As well as celebrating Fathers Day this weekend also brings us fully back into Ordinary Time Though we returned to this part of the liturgical year after Pentecost weve been celebrating solemnities over the past two weekends For the coming weeks and months we will now remain in Ordinary Time until the end of the liturgical year in November During this time we will see the liturgical color of Green return as well as resuming our walk with the Lord through the Gospel of St Matthew As you may recall during the beginning of Ordinary Time which fell between the end of the Christmas season and the beginning of Lent our homilies walked us through the various parts of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass As our readings during Ordinary Time consistently reflect our Lords ministry it often remains an opportune moment to focus the homilies over several weekends on specific themes Over the next several weekends the homilies will have a special focus on our Faith With this weekends consistent call to have courage under persecution Do not be afraid our Blessed Lord asks us to acknowledge Him We encounter Him in so many ways but most especially within the Sacred Tradition through the Sacred Scriptures and in the Most Holy Eucharist We encounter all three of these every time that we assist at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass And for the next several weekends we will focus on that which has been handed down to us from Christ Himself The word tradition comes from the Latin tradere which means that which is handed on Our Catholic Faith offers two thousand years of richness to aid us in our relationship with Jesus Christ From the Sacraments to the lives of the Saints to the various writings of the Church Fathers the Body of Christ which is the Church continues to pour forth His grace As St Paul says to St Timothy the Church stands as the pillar and foundation of the truth 1 Timothy 315 To avail ourselves to these riches however call us to grow in knowledge of and familiarity with them Again from St Paul we are called to stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught either by an oral statement or by a letter of ours 2 Thessalo nians 215 Weekday Mass Times With Fr Felicichias departure and my shifting class schedule each week
