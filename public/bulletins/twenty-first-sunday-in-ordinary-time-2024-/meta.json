weekend August 24th 25th the Church celebrates the Twenty first Sunday in Ordinary Time After five full weeks we are concluding our walk through of the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St John Having heard from both the Feeding of the Five Thousand and the Bread of Life Discourse we have received our Lord's teaching on the Holy Eucharist Starting next weekend we will resume our walk through of the Gospel of St Mark for the remainder of the liturgical year Though we are concluding our walk through of the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St John we actually end two verses shy of completing the chapter Our Gospel reading today ends on a high note with John 669 and the words of St Peter Asked if they too shall abandon Him like the others St Peter answers for the Twelve that they will not and cannot abandon Him for they have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God The remaining two verses of the chapter however take a different turn from the beautiful words of St Peter After this proclamation of fidelity the Lord then references for the first time in the Gospel of St John the coming betrayal of Judas This betrayal culminates of course in John 13 when Judas leaves the Last Supper to go forth and betray the Lord The very same Lord who gives us His body freely as food is sold by Judas for thirty pieces of silver These elements of Judas betrayal first announced at the Bread of Life Discourse and brought to completion at the Last Supper shows us how closely fidelity and intimacy with the Lord are intrinsically tied to the Holy Eucharist Truly our reception of the Holy Eucharist is meant to unite us ever more closely to the Lord May we see in the Holy Eucharist the greatest of gifts that truly binds us ever more closely with the Lord Himself Catholicism Explained Thursday Sept 5th On Thursday September 5th at 6:30PM in the Parish Social Hall we will have an introduction to this year's Catholic Explained Series Utilizing a new textbook this series will help us to gain and deepen an appreciation and understanding of the Catholic Faith This series is open to all To Catholics who want to learn more about our Faith to non Catholics who are interested in joining the Church and to all those who are interested in just learning more about Catholicism If you know of anyone interested in attending especially those who may have an interest in joining the Church please personally invite them to attend The best form of advertisement is always a personal invitation And for all that we know such an invitation may be the starting point for helping another deepen their relation with Jesus Christ and His Church If this time does not work for someone interested in learning more please have them contact me directly We will do everything we can to find a time that will work It is my hope that we will fill the Social Hall for this series May we never be afraid to go forth and invite other's to come and encounter the Lord in His Church just as we have done All are welcome and invited to come and see Annual Bishop's Appeal In coming weeks all registered households will receive a mailing from Bishop Rhoades to kick off the Annual Bishop's Appeal One of the great parts of our Catholic Faith is its universality This means that our charitable outreach extends beyond our own parish and aids those both near and far In addition to our support of missions throughout the world this annual appeal helps to fund various ministries and outreaches throughout our local diocese The diocesan wide goal of the appeal is divided among the 80 parishes of our diocese With our continued parish growth over these past several years we have seen a significant increase of our parish goal this year Our Annual Bishop's Appeal Goal this year is 4684636 All donations above our parish goal are returned to our parish To learn more about the appeal or to make a donation online visit wwwdiocesefwsborgaba Weekend of August 31st September 1st 500
