  "text": "HE SSUMPTION OF THE LESSED IRGIN ARY UGUST 15 2021 This weekend August 14th15th the Church celebrates the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary This solemnity though offi cially declared a dogma of the Church by Pope Pius XII on November 1 1950 can be traced back to the earliest centuries of the life of the Church With the toleration of Christianity by the Edict of Milan 311 AD Christian holy sites would eventually become celebrated locations where churches were built One such location close to Mount Zion was centered around the empty Tomb of Mary At the empty Tomb of Mary devotion to the Blessed Virgin was marked with local celebration surrounding Marys having been taken into heaven This celebration quickly spread throughout the Church and became known as both the Dormition of Mary and the Assumption of Mary Though no biblical account is recorded of Marys Assumption the tradition and practice of the Church has reechoed this belief throughout the ages At the Council of Chalcedon 451 AD when asked to bring a relic of the Blessed Mother to the council by the Emperor Marcian the Patriarch of Jerusalem St Juvenal responded that this was not possible Sharing with the emperor this ancient teaching he stated that it is known that Mary had died in the presence of the Apostles But her tomb when opened upon the request of St Thomas the Apostle was found empty The Apostles concluded that her body was taken up into heaven This belief in the Assumption has continued to be handed on throughout the ages The word Assumption itself comes from the Latin verb assumere which means to take to oneself The meaning of the word itself helps to clearly express the teaching of the Assumption That Our Lord Jesus Christ took His Mother home to Himself where He is In this way the Blessed Virgin continues to serve as our model pointing us towards heaven and He with whom she now resides her Son Jesus Christ Marking this solemnity though we have spent the past three weekends exploring the Eucharist in the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St John we are briefly interrupted by the Gospel of St Luke This deviation gives us the opportunity to consider the heavenly destiny to which the Eucharist helps us aspire It is this same heavenly destiny to which Our Lady has already so gloriously attained and that which we hope to one day share in Until that time may we continue to ask the Blessed Virgin to continue to intercede for us to Our Lord Jesus Christ EACHING ASS UGUST 22ND AND UGUST 25TH In place of our August Discussion Forum we will once again offer a Teaching Mass on both Sunday August 22nd from 8:30AM 9:30AM and Wednesday August 25th after the 7:00PM evening Mass Note Teaching Mass is NOT a Mass It is a walkthrough and offers explanations of the various parts of the Mass This walkthrough offers us a chance to more fully immerse ourselves into the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass Teaching Mass offers the chance to delve into the scriptural spiritual historical and practical aspects of the liturgy itself As weve focused on the past few weekends The way we pray is the way we believe As the Mass is the greatest and highest act of prayer Benedict XVI it exemplifies our belief We are called to live out the Mass in our daily lives All are welcome to join us for the Teaching Mass Invite Family Friends Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS
