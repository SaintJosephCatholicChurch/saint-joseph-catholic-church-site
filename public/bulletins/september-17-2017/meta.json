Cotterman 24TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME SEPTEMBER 17TH 2017 YR From the Pastors Desk WE ARE ALL INVITED TO FORGIVE BE KIND AND MERCIFUL My dear brothers and sisters in Christ I say peace be with you all Our Annual Bishop Appeal is with us Today is the KICK OFF day We have your envelops at the Nar thex Please pick up yours as you go after the Mass Then the coming week Sept 24 is the PLEDGE SUNDAY We shall watch the Bishops Appeal Video Please do your best to participate Let us try to have 100 participation this time We did well last year I hope we will do better this year Thanks in advance for participating and giving generously In todays Liturgy we are called to forgive be kind and merciful Jesus came to elevate human nature and not to destroy it He came to preserve the best in us and enable us to be what a Christian man or woman child or the youth should be Hatred revenge and anger are human vices The law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth are Old Testament ethics but not Christian Jesus came and Christianized it So you must take a realistic look at yourself and check where your personality should be Christian ized The child human in us may be vengeful but God whom we should follow is different Todays responsorial Psalm show us who God is The Lord is kind and mer ciful slow to anger and rich in compassion Thus in the 1st Reading Sir 2730287 The book of Sirach explains to us the dan ger of hate revenge wrath anger unforgiving heart been mad at people etc These are really bad Please avoid them It says The vengeful will suffer the Lords vengeance for he remembers their sins in detail This is frightening The Lord continues Forgive your neighbors injustice then when you pray your own sins will be for given To be saved we must overlook all injustices done to us by others to save our souls on the Day of Judgment In the 2nd Reading Rom 1479St Paul tells us that we need one another We are not autonomous We must see Jesus in our neighbor This will help us to forgive all injustices done to us For the Lord Jesus said about those who killed Him Father for give them for they know not what they are doing cf Lk 2334 And in the Gospel Mt 182135 Jesus through the two parables said it all Peter thought that by forgiving 7 times he has done a wonderful thing But Jesus said Not seven times but seventyseven times This means uncountable Our forgiveness must be unlimited We must forgive as the master forgave his servant But because the ser vant failed to forgive his fellow servant he terribly So as the Lord is kind and merciful we should be forgiving towards one another Our forgiveness should be without limit and so reflect Christs eternal love For He alone is the Lord Forgive and you shall be forgiven Let go all injustices done to you for the sake of the Kingdom of God Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it God bless you Rev Msgr Pius Ilechukwu Heaven is for us all I hope you are doing something about it NB 1 We are
