  "text": "HIRD UNDAY OF DVENT ECEMBER 12 2021 This weekend December 11th 12th the Church joyfully celebrates the Third Sunday of Advent or Gaudete Sunday Marking the halfway point of Advent Gaudete Sunday reminds us that we are called to Rejoice that the coming of Jesus Christ is near As with any penitential season in the liturgical year we are reminded that Christian penance is meant to prepare us for something greater and will always give way to joy As a happy coincidence Gaudete Sunday this year also falls on the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe As depicted in our own stained glass window of Our Lady of Guadalupe we see an image of our Blessed Mother while she is pregnant with the Lord as indicated in Aztec culture by the black sash around her waist Our Blessed Mother stands as a true model of anticipation and rejoicing at the coming manifestation of Gods plan for humanity and in our own lives Joining our Blessed Mother in this eager anticipation for the coming of Christ we will also enter into the Antiphons this coming Friday December 17th This ancient practice begun in the 4th Century addresses Christ with seven Messianic titles based on Old Testament prophecies Taking the first letter of each title forms a Latin acrostic Ero cras which means I am coming tomorrow These antiphons not only bring intensity to our Advent preparation but bring it to a joyful conclusion NNUAL ISHOP PPEAL I want to offer a special Thank You for your generosity to the Annual Bishops Appeal this year Not only did we exceed our parishs goal we did so by a substantial amount Its also not too late to give if you havent had a chance yet any amount given now comes directly back to our parish We will be putting the overgoal amount we receive back from the Diocese towards new playground equipment for our campus Our current playground equipment has served well over the years but the wooden structures after three decades of wearandtear and being out in the elements are in need of replacement both for safety and insurance purposes We will also use this chance to relocate the playground moving it fifty feet southeast of its current location This relocation will help resolve several drainage issues that have been affecting the foundation of the parish gym These valuable improvements to our parish campus are made possible not only by our Bishops Appeal overage but also by the fundraising efforts of both our GIRLs Night Out and Knights of Columbus over this past year Thank you all for your continued support of the maintenance and upkeep of our beautiful parish campus We rejoice to know that it will continue to serve our parish family and community for generations to come ID OU NOW AMPAIGN In January we will begin our Did You Know Campaign This outreach suggested by our Parish Council will plan to make use of newspaper ads bulletin inserts homilies and various other materials and mediums to help spread information about our Faith We hope that this might also help to clear up some commonly held misconceptions about the Catholic Church Our first subject will be Did You Know Catholics are Christians This subject will look at our own role as disciples of the Lord If you have any suggestions for other topics that you would like to see covered over time feel free to reach out and let me know Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS INTENTIONS Saturday December 11
