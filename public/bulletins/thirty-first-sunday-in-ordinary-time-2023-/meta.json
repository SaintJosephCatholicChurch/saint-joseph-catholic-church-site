First Sunday in Ordinary Time November 5 2023 special Thank You to all those who assisted with our Masses and events throughout the week for both All Saints Day and All Souls Day wonderful evening all around it was especially joyful to be joined by all of our little Saints in the procession at Mass on Wednesday evening Our little Saints serve as a visual reminder of the relationship that we are called into with the Saints They are not separated from or beyond us Instead we are all united as one in the Body of Christ As part of our All Saints Day Costume Contest you can vote for your favorite Saint in the narthex this weekend On the holy day we also had the opportunity to vote for the winners of our Youth Group's Pumpkin Carving Contest With many masterful designs the voting was very close Congratulations to this year's winners 1st 2nd and 3rd Forty Hours Devotion Our parish's Forty Hours Devotion will be held at the end of this month Beginning on Monday November 27th with Mass at 7 PM our parish family is being called into an extended period of Eucharistic Adoration On Tuesday November 28th we will have the opportunity to join together for sung Vespers which is the evening prayer of the Church at 6:30PM and hear an exhilarating eucharistic conference at 7 PM Finally we will conclude with a closing Mass on Wednesday November 29th at 7 PM Between these events the Blessed Sacrament will be exposed in the Church throughout all hours of the night and day As meaningful as our scheduled events will be it is this time between the events that are perhaps most important It is in these moments that you are being invited to spend time before our Eucharistic Lord Himself It is here in these special moments of silence before Him where the Lord will speak to our hearts and we will be most prepared to hear His voice I encourage you to give of an hour of your time and sign up for an hour of adoration with the Lord throughout our Forty Hours I know that this will be difficult to do especially as the hours are scheduled throughout the weekdays Yet part of this devotion means making a sacrifice of our time for God It means recognizing that as busy as we might be we need God in our day and that we in turn are willing to give even just a small part of our day to Him How important is it to make this sacrifice of time and spend an hour with the Lord In the Sacred Scriptures the only time that our Lord asked His Apostles for anything was when He pleaded with them to watch with Him for but one hour cf Matthew 2640 45 That plea continues even unto our own day We must ask ourselves Are we willing to respond to this request and spend an hour before Him to watch and pray Faithfully in Christ Fr David special Thank You to Fr Bill Sullivan for offering our Masses this weekend while I am away to celebrate the wedding of a friend in Maryland Though a short trip Friday Sunday I look forward to visiting with a number of friends and our diocesan seminarians studying in
