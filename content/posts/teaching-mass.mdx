On Thursday, September 8th, we will offer a “Teaching Mass” in the Church from 7:30 – 8:30 PM.

This event is being offered as a part of our Catholicism Explained Program. All are invited to join us to learn more about the Mass.

Note: A “Teaching Mass” is not an actual Mass. Our daily Mass that day will be offered at it’s normal time: 8:00 AM. Instead, a “Teaching Mass” is a chance for us to walk-through, ask questions about, and explain the various parts of the Mass in a more in-depth manner.
