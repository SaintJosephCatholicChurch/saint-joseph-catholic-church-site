  "text": "IGHTEENTH UNDAY IN RDINARY IME August 2 2020 You may recall that in March Bishop Rhoades had offered a general dispensation of all the Faithful from the obligation to attend Mass on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation until August 15th Earlier this week in union with the bishops of the four other dioceses in Indiana the Dioceses of Evansville Gary Indianapolis and Lafayette Bishop Rhoades has extended this general dispensation until November 1st Bishop Rhoades and the other bishops will continue to monitor developments throughout the state and will once again reevaluate this general dispensation in the coming months What does this mean for us at St Joseph We will continue with our public liturgies while following the general safety precautions asked of us by the Bishop as we have been doing for the past several months The reason that the Bishop is extending this general dispensation is for the Faithful who might be ill who might be susceptible to illness who might be caring for those suscepti ble to illness and those who do not yet feel comfortable returning to large gatherings For those who fall into these categories it may not yet be prudent for them to return to Mass in person either due to their own health or the health of those for whom they care This is of course an individual decision All are welcome to attend the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass inperson In fact we look forward to the day when every one of us will be ready and able to join together again at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass inperson We miss seeing you For those however who are not yet ready or able to return to large social gatherings Bishop extends this general dispensation For those who cannot yet join us in person we will continue to livestream our daily Masses and our 10 AM Sunday Mass We are currently working with local Stylus Technology to improve our livestreaming capabili ties with a permanent and dedicated camera system This does mean that our additional Sunday Mass time at 12:30PM will continue for the foreseeable future At the moment it is my intention that this additional Mass time will not become a permanent part of our Mass schedule It will however continue to be offered for the foreseeable future at least through November This is our least attended Mass time which is actually as it is intended to be As it is less attended this allows parishioners who may not yet be ready to be in large crowds and would not feel comfortable at our normal Mass times a Mass time that they can attend Amidst of all of this our Gospel reading for today Matthew 142233 offers a very powerful message Take courage it is I do not be afraid As disciples of Jesus Christ we are called to put our trust in Him And in doing so we know that He will guide us through all things We see this very clearly in the example of St Peter Upon seeing the Lord walking on the water St Peter asks to join Him When the Lord calls St Peter to come to Him St Peter is able to step out of the boat and walk on the water As he is walking however he remembers that they are in the midst of a storm And as he begins to look around he begins to sink Why does he sink Because he took his eyes off of Jesus As St Peter is sinking he does what every disciple should do He calls out to Jesus St Peter in his dire need has returned his attention to Jesus And Jesus responds Jesus pulls him out of the water and walks him back to the boat Once they are safely back in the boat only then does the storm calm Jesus pulled St Peter out of the water and walked him safely through the storm When our eyes remain fixed on Jesus even as the waves may be crash ing upon we can safely overcome any storm because Jesus Himself will guide us through As He said to the disciples then He says to us disciples now
