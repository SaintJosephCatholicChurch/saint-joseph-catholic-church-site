  "text": "WENTY OURTH UNDAY I RDINARY IME EPTEMBER 12 2021 Last weekend a couple visiting our parish mentioned to me how excited they were to see so many children and young families at Mass I hear similar comments on a regular basis from our visitors who stop to chat after Mass Thank you to everyone for always being so welcoming and especially for being welcoming and encouraging to our young families at Mass with their children It is great to receive such encouraging feedback and it makes me even more excited for the bright future of our parish This weekend September 11th 12th the Church celebrates the Twenty fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time In our Gospel reading Mark 82735 our Lord states the full cost of discipleship Death to self In selfdenial we learn to live for others we learn sacrifice we learn love In sacrifice we are called to unite ourselves to the one sacrifice of Jesus Christ offered upon the Cross and to which we are made present to at the altar We can often find sacrifice in so many ways in our lives One such way is found in the ultimate sacrifice made by those in our armed services As this past Saturday marked the 20th commemoration of the horrific attacks on our country we reflect upon the sacrifices made by so many Our hearts are even more heavy because of the tragedies that have occurred in Afghanistan in the past few weeks To the veterans of our parish thank you for your service and sacrifice We hope that you know of our gratefulness for your efforts May the thousands of lives that were bettered because of your sacrifice throughout the world be a source of consolation and a sense of accomplishment for you Let us all pray for the members of our military our first responders and all innocent bystanders in the face of conflict NNUAL ISHOP PPEAL This month marks the kickoff of our 35th Annual Bishops Appeal Witness to Hope This yearly diocesan campaign helps to finance the many good works of our diocese including education direct charitable work food banks health clinics etc and many different community ministries and service projects The Annual Bishops Appeal directly supports these many and various ministries and outreaches throughout our diocese With Bishop Rhoades reaching out to every parish family throughout the diocese many have already received his annual letter this past month For this years appeal our parishs appeal quota is 3953703 Thanks to your wonderful generosity our parish has consistently met our annual quota and I believe we will be able to do so again this year Outside of financial fundraising our parish goal this year is to have 100 participation in the appeal What does 100 participation mean This means that all parish families return their pledge cards for the appeal Even if you may not be in a position to offer financial support this year please still return your pledge card Any donations that exceed our quota will be returned to our parish This year we will be dedicating any overage that is returned to our parish to be put towards the cost of our new parish playground Our current parish playground on the northend of our campus near the Rosary Path is over 20 years old and is in need of replacement Our Knights of Columbus have been handling the various arrangements and we hope to have our new parish playground installed this coming Spring Faithfully in Christ Fr David MASS
