Family of Jesus Mary and Joseph December 28 2025 This weekend December 27th 28th the Church celebrates the Feast of the Holy Family of Jesus Mary and Joseph Falling immediately after our celebrations on Christmas Day this feast day emphasizes how the Holy Family serves as the exemplary model for Christian family life The grace of the Incarnation is not contained to Christmas Day but is meant to dwell among us and shape the ordinary and everyday life of our own families At the close of our 10 AM Mass this Sunday we will process the Blessed Sacrament to our temporary daily Mass chapel in the Parish Conference Room This will allow us to begin moving our liturgical furnishings from the Church to the Parish Social Hall after Mass By Wednesday evening and our vigil Mass for the Solemnity of Mary Mother of God the Social Hall will have been transformed into a make shift sanctuary for the next few months Thank you for your patience and flexibility over these next few months Throughout the planning process we have worked to anticipate the various challenges that may arise and to prepare accordingly Our parish goal during this time is to ensure that our church remains both accessible and able to seat as many people as possible for all who join us in prayer For our weekend and Holy Day liturgies a team of volunteer ushers will be available to assist with lift use before and after Mass helping ensure that the Parish Social Hall remains fully accessible to all If you are willing to volunteer to serve in this role and assist our fellow parishioners please contact the Parish Office for more information For our weekday liturgies the Parish Conference Room has been arranged to maximize accessible seating Please note this does require that our daily Masses be celebrated ad orientem in the Conference Room meaning that the Tabernacle is secured on the altar and during the Eucharistic Prayer the celebrant faces with the Faithful towards the Tabernacle This arrangement allows us to increase available seating in the room by approximately one third Solemnity of Mary Mother of God Holy Day of Obligation On Thursday January 1st the Church celebrates the Solemnity of Mary Mother of God This ancient celebration traces itself back to the 5th Century At the Council of Ephesus in AD 431 Mary was recognized as Theotokos or God bearer by the Church This title though given to the Blessed Mother truly emphasizes that Jesus is both true God and true man As with all things Marian our Blessed Mother always points us right back to her Son The Solemnity of Mary Mother of God is a Holy Day of Obligation To help ensure that we have the opportunity to meet our obligation of assisting at Mass on this day we will have Masses for the Holy Day as follows Wednesday Dec 31st Vigil Mass 5:00PM Thursday Jan 1st Mass 7:30AM and 10:00AM Note Masses will be held in the Parish Social Hall due to renovations in the Church Living with the Saints in the New Year As we gather to celebrate the coming Holy Day and New Year celebration we will continue our parish tradition of choosing a Saint to spend the coming year with As we know however in the wise and loving plan of Jesus Christ it is not we who choose the Saint but the Saints who chooses us As we have so many friends in Heaven should we not strive each year to learn a little more about them each year and grow closer in relationship with them You will find a basket by the Social Hall doors with little strips of paper each with a Saint's name and a biographical information for you to choose from This practice first started by Saint Faustina Kowalska among the Sisters in her convent invites us to spend the year learning about our Saint both historically and spiritually By inviting these Saints into our lives they become intercessors on our behalf before the Lord as we enter the New Year Saturday December 27 8:00am Special Intention 830 9:00am Confession 400 4:45pm Confession 4:35pm Rosary 5:00pm Norbert
